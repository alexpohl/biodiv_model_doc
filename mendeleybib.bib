This is the purpose of the paleo-altimetry. The most commonly applied paleo-altimetry method is based on the isotopic oxygen composition of the carbonate archives. It reflects the composition of past rain, which at present-day and in the most mountain ranges becomes progressively more depleted in heavy isotopes with altitude. Assuming that this depletion remains valid in the past, the elevation of the Tibetan Plateau in the Eocene (about 42 millions years ago) is estimated to be about 4 000 m. However, other proxy data indicate on the contrary low altitudes. Is the relationship between the rain isotopic composition and the altitude that is observed today applicable to the Eocene? This is what we tried to verify using an atmospheric general circulation model, LMDZ-iso. We find that in the Eocene, the atmospheric circulation and hydrological processes were so different to the present-day that the isotopic observations in the Eocene carbonates are actually consistent with relatively low altitudes of the Plateau. This allows us to reconcile different methods of paleo-altimetry in agreement with more recent (post-Eocene) uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.},

abstract = {There is significant geographic variation in species richness. However, the nature of the underlying relationships, such as that between species richness and environmental stability, remains unclear. The stability-time hypothesis suggests that environmental instability reduces species richness by suppressing speciation and increasing extinction risk. By contrast, the patch-mosaic hypothesis suggests that small-scale environmental instability can increase species richness by providing a steady supply of non-equilibrium environments. Although these hypotheses are often applied to different time scales, their core mechanisms are in conflict. Reconciling these apparently competing hypotheses is key to understanding how environmental conditions shape the distribution of biodiversity. Here, we use REvoSim, an individual-based, eco-evolutionary system, to model the evolution of sessile organisms in environments with varying magnitudes and scales of environmental instability. We demonstrate that when environments have substantial permanent heterogeneity, a high level of localized environmental instability reduces biodiversity, whereas in environments lacking permanent heterogeneity, high levels of localized instability increase biodiversity. By contrast, broad-scale environmental instability, acting on the same time scale, invariably reduces biodiversity. Our results provide a new view of the biodiversity-disturbance relationship that reconciles contrasting hypotheses within a single model and implies constraints on the environmental conditions under which those hypotheses apply. These constraints can inform attempts to conserve adaptive potential in different environments during the current biodiversity crisis.},

abstract = {The stable isotope compositions of biogenic carbonates have been used for paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic reconstructions for decades, and produced some of the most iconic records in the field. However, we still lack a fully mechanistic understanding of the stable isotope proxies, especially the biological overprint on the environmental signals termed “vital effects”. A ubiquitous feature of stable isotope vital effects in marine calcifying organisms is a strong correlation between $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C in a range of values that are depleted from inorganic calcite/aragonite. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain this correlation, one based on kinetic isotope effects during CO2(aq)-HCO3− inter-conversion, the other based on equilibrium isotope exchange during pH dependent speciation of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool. Neither mechanism explains all the stable isotope features observed in biogenic carbonates. Here we present a fully kinetic model of biomineralization and its isotope effects using deep-sea corals as a test organism. A key component of our model is the consideration of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in catalyzing the CO2(aq)-HCO3− inter-conversion reactions in the extracellular calcifying fluid (ECF). We find that the amount of carbonic anhydrase not only modulates the carbonate chemistry of the calcifying fluid, but also helps explain the slope of the $\delta$18O-$\delta$13C correlation. Differences in CA activity in the biomineralization process can possibly explain the observed range of $\delta$18O-$\delta$13C slopes in different calcifying organisms. A mechanistic understanding of stable isotope vital effects with numerical models can help us develop better paleoceanographic tracers.},

abstract = {Drastic paleogeography changes in the Indonesian archipelago over the Plio-Pleistocene, either in response to sea level oscillations or vertical land motion, enabled the periodic emergence of the Sunda shelf. When emerged, this wide continental platform in the heart of the Maritime Continent may have modified regional and global climate systems. We investigate the effect of the exposure of the Sunda shelf on climate dynamics using a set of numerical simulations with (i) atmosphere-land surface and (ii) fully coupled general circulation models. We first explore the impact of convection schemes on the rainfall regime simulated over the Maritime Continent and show how they could explain the discrepancies among previous studies. We further depict a robust and common mechanism that prevails. We show that diurnal heating of the surface of the continental platform enhances low-level convergence and local convection, and fosters local precipitations. This effect, to a second order, is modulated by the radiative effect and increased turbulent heat flux driven by vegetated surface properties such as albedo or roughness. Increasing precipitations over the exposed platform also impacts freshwater export into seawater, making salinity of the Indian Ocean and Indonesian Throughflow highly dependent on the routing scheme over the exposed shelf.},

abstract = {Benthic animals profoundly influence the cycling and storage of carbon and other elements in marine systems, particularly in coastal sediments. Recent climate change has altered the distribution and abundance of many seafloor taxa and modified the vertical exchange of materials between ocean and sediment layers. Here, we examine how climate change could alter animal-mediated biogeochemical cycling in ocean sediments. The fossil record shows repeated major responses from the benthos during mass extinctions and global carbon perturbations, including reduced diversity, dominance of simple trace fossils, decreased burrow size and bioturbation intensity, and nonrandom extinction of trophic groups. The broad dispersal capacity of many extant benthic species facilitates poleward shifts corresponding to their environmental niche as overlying water warms. Evidence suggests that locally persistent populations will likely respond to environmental shifts through either failure to respond or genetic adaptation rather than via phenotypic plasticity. Regional and global ocean models insufficiently integrate changes in benthic biological activity and their feedbacks on sedimentary biogeochemical processes. The emergence of bioturbation, ventilation, and seafloor-habitat maps and progress in our mechanistic understanding of organism–sediment interactions enable incorporation of potential effects of climate change on benthic macrofaunal mediation of elemental cycles into regional and global ocean biogeochemical models.},

abstract = {Past changes in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (PCO2) have had a major impact on earth system dynamics; yet, reconstructing secular trends of past PCO2 remains a prevalent challenge in paleoclimate studies. The current long-term PCO2 reconstructions rely largely on the compilation of many different proxies, often with discrepancies among proxies, particularly for periods older than 100 million years (Ma). Here, we reconstructed Phanerozoic PCO2 from a single proxy: the stable carbon isotopic fractionation associated with photosynthesis (Ɛp) that increases as PCO2 increases. This concept has been widely applied to alkenones, but here, we expand this concept both spatially and temporally by applying it to all marine phytoplankton via a diagenetic product of chlorophyll, phytane. We obtained data from 306 marine sediments and oils, which showed that Ɛp ranges from 11 to 24, agreeing with the observed range of maximum fractionation of Rubisco (i.e., 25 to 28). The observed secular PCO2 trend derived from phytane-based Ɛp mirrors the available compilations of PCO2 over the past 420 Ma, except for two periods in which our higher estimates agree with the warm climate during those time periods. Our record currently provides the longest secular trend in PCO2 based on a single marine proxy, covering the past 500 Ma of Earth history.},

However, the impacts of temperature on viral infection of phytoplankton are not well understood. Here we coupled mathematical modelling with experiments to explore the effect of temperature on virus-phytoplankton interactions. Our model shows the negative consequences of high temperatures on infection and suggests a temperature-dependent threshold between viral production and degradation. Modelling long-term dynamics in environments with different average temperatures revealed the potential for long-term host-virus coexistence, epidemic free or habitat loss states. We generalised our model to variation in global sea surface temperatures corresponding to present and future seas and show that climate change may differentially influence virus-host dynamics depending on the virus-host pair. Temperature-dependent changes in the infectivity of virus particles may lead to shifts in virus-host habitats in warmer oceans, analogous to projected changes in the habitats of macro-, microorganisms and pathogens.},

abstract = {Oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere and oceans occurred across three major steps during the Paleoproterozoic, Neoproterozoic, and Paleozoic eras, with each increase having profound consequences for the biosphere. Biological or tectonic revolutions have been proposed to explain each of these stepwise increases in oxygen, but the principal driver of each event remains unclear. Here we show, using a theoretical model, that the observed oxygenation steps are a simple consequence of internal feedbacks in the long-term biogeochemical cycles of carbon, oxygen, and phosphorus, and that there is no requirement for a specific stepwise external forcing to explain the course of Earth surface oxygenation. We conclude that Earth's oxygenation events are entirely consistent with gradual oxygenation of the planetary surface after the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.},

@article{Arvidson2014,
abstract = {The onset of pelagic sedimentation attending the radiation of pelagic calcifiers during the Mesozoic was an important divide in Earth history, shifting the locus of significant carbonate sedimentation from the shallow shelf environments of the Paleozoic to the deep sea. This shift would have impacted the CO2 cycle, given that decarbonation of subducted pelagic carbonate is an important return flux of CO2 to the atmosphere. Coupled with the fact that the mean residence time of continental platform and basin sedimentary carbonate exceeds that of the oceanic crust, it thus becomes unclear whether carbon cycling would have operated on a substantially different footing prior to the pelagic transition. Here, we examine this uncertainty with sensitivity analyses of the timing of this transition using a coupled model of the Phanerozoic atmosphere, ocean, and shallow lithosphere. For purposes of comparison, we establish an age of 250 Ma (i.e., after the Permo-Triassic extinctions) as the earliest opportunity for deposition of extensive biogenic pelagic carbonate on the deep seafloor, an age that predates known occurrences of pelagic calcifiers (and intact seafloor). Although an approximate boundary, we do show that attempts to shift this datum either significantly earlier or later in time produce model results that are inconsistent with observed trends in the mass-age distribution of the rock record and with accepted trends in seawater composition as constrained by proxy data. Significantly, we also conclude that regardless of the timing of the onset of biogenic pelagic carbonate sedimentation, a carbon sink involving seawater-derived dissolved inorganic carbon played a critical role in carbon cycling, particularly in the Paleozoic. This CaCO3 sink may have been wholly abiogenic, involving calcium derived either directly from seawater (thus manifest as a direct seafloor deposit), or alternatively from basalt-seawater reactions (represented by precipitation of CaCO3 in veins and fissures within the basalt). Despite the uncertainty in the source and magnitude of this abiogenic CaCO3 flux, it is likely a basic and permanent feature of global carbon cycling. Subduction of this CaCO3 would have acted as a basic return circuit for atmospheric CO2 even in the absence of biogenically derived pelagic carbonate sedimentation. Lastly, model calculations of the ratio of dissolved calcium to carbonate ion (Ca2+/CO32-) show this quantity underwent significant secular evolution over the Phanerozoic. As there is increasing recognition of this ratio's role in CaCO3 growth and dissolution reactions, this evolution, together with progressive increases in nutrient availability and saturation state, may have created a tipping point ultimately conducive to the appearance of pelagic calcifiers in the Mesozoic. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The relative strength of these forces determines how ecosystems respond to environmental gradients, how much diversity is resident in a community or population at any given time, and how populations reorganize and evolve in response to environmental perturbations. In this study, we introduce a globally resolved population–genetic ocean model in order to examine the interplay of dispersal, selection, and adaptive evolution and their effects on community assembly and global biogeography. We find that environmental selection places strong constraints on global dispersal, even in the face of extremely high assumed rates of adaptation. Changing the relative strengths of dispersal, selection, and adaptation has pronounced effects on community assembly in the model and suggests that barriers to dispersal play a key role in the structuring of marine communities, enhancing global biodiversity and the importance of local historical contingencies.},

abstract = {Most bryozoans have calcareous skeletons that locally contribute large amounts of carbonate sediment to the sea floor. Whereas Recent bryozoans are diverse in shelf seas pan-globally, it is only in mid to high latitudes that they are potential limestone producers; tropical bryozoans invariably have too small a biomass relative to other carbonate producers (corals, algae and molluscs) to be important sources of sediment. During the Palaeozoic, however, bryozoan-rich depos-its were formed at all palaeolatitudes, including the tropics. Extending the work of Taylor & Allison (1998), we have compiled data on 42 occurrences of bryozoan-rich deposits of Ordovician age to determine whether the Palaeozoic dis-tributional pattern extends back to their earliest appearance in the fossil record. Estimated palaeolatitudes of deposition ranged from 10-75°, but the majority (71%) were found to be tropical, i.e. < 23.5°. Of the 14 reefal occurrences, 11 (79%) were formed in tropical palaeolatitudes. No significant trend in depositional palaeolatitude could be detected with time through the Ordovician. The most persuasive explanation for the broader palaeolatitudinal distribution of bryozoan-rich deposits (including reefs) in the Ordovician than at the present day is that durophagous predators were ecologically unimportant, allowing large erect, sediment-producing bryozoan colonies to grow in the tropics where to-day they are vulnerable to grazing fishes, decapods and echinoderms.},

abstract = {The widespread growth of reefs formed by a framework of biogenic constructors and frame-lacking carbonate mounds began on Baltica during Ordovician time. Previously, Ordovician reef and mound development on Baltica was considered to be sporadic and local. A review of all known bioherm localities across the Baltic Basin reveals a more consistent pattern. Ordovician bioherms grew in a wide E-W-aligned belt across the Baltic Basin and occur in several places in Norway. Substantial reef development began simultaneously across the region during the late Sandbian - early Katian interval and climaxed during the late Katian Pirgu age. The current spatiotemporal distribution of bioherms is a result of interdependent factors that involve original drivers of reef development such as relative sea level, climate during the time of deposition and effects of post-depositional erosion. Oceanographic conditions were likely more favourable during times of cooler global climates, low sea level and glacial episodes. At the same time, the likelihood that bioherms are preserved from long-term erosion is higher when deposited during low sea level in deeper parts of the basin. A main factor controlling the timing of the reef and mound evolution was Baltica's shift toward palaeotropical latitudes during Late Ordovician time. The time equivalence between initial reef growth and the Guttenberg isotope carbon excursion (GICE) suggests that global climatic conditions were important.},

abstract = {The Broeggeria assemblage is a peculiar brachiopod association that has been recorded mainly from Tremadocian black shales of Baltoscandia, the Anglo-Welsh Basin, Nova Scotia, South Urals and Kazakhstan. Here, we report a low diversity brachiopod association dominated by Broggeria omaguaca n. sp. from upper Tremadocian open-shelf mudstones of northwestern Argentina. The dark-grey transgressive muddy interval bearing the Broeggeria assemblage starts with an erosive flooding surface marked by a glauconite-rich bed containing reworked bioclasts, which overlies storm-dominated shoreface sandstones. Lithologic and taphonomic evidence indicates that the fauna from the mudstones represents a palaeocommunity inhabiting oxygen-depleted bottoms. Besides Broeggeria omaguaca, which by far is the more abundant linguloid, the assemblage includes the obolids Palaeoglossa elongata (Harrington) and Libecoviella aff. tilcarensis Benedetto and Mu{\~{n}}oz, and the punctate orthide Lipanorthis andinus Benedetto. Associated trilobites are abundant and low diversity, the more common being the large asaphid Asaphellus jujuanus Harrington. Coeval strata exposed in the Santa Victoria area contain rare specimens of Broeggeria omaguaca associated with Leptembolon argentinum Benedetto and Mu{\~{n}}oz and Palaeoglossa elongata. Comparable dysoxic black shales of Furongian age bearing the olenid trilobite Parabolina (Neoparabolina) frequens have yielded a monospecific association of Lingulella n. sp. The records of Broeggeria at global scale support its late Cambrian origin in the Anglo-Welsh Basin (Avalonia) and its rapid migration into the Karatau–Naryn terrane (a part of the Kazakhstanian collage). By the early Tremadocian, Broeggeria spread to Belgium and to the neighbouring Megumia terrane, migrating later (mid-late Tremadocian) to Baltica, Southern Urals, Kazakhstanian terranes, Perunica and the Central Andean Basin. By the late Floian/early Dapingian, Broeggeria colonized palaeoequatorial deep shelves (Spitsbergen). Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The availability of nutrients and the quantity and quality of food at the base of food webs have largely been ignored in discussions of the Phanerozoic record of biodiversity. We examine the role of nutrient availability and phytoplankton stoichiometry (the relative proportions of inorganic nutrients to carbon) in the diversification of the marine biosphere. Nutrient availability and phytoplankton stoichiometry played a critical role in the initial diversification of the marine biosphere during the Neoproterozoic. Initial biosphere expansion during this time resulted in the massive sequestration of nutrients into biomass which, along with the geologically slow input of nutrients from land, set the stage for severe nutrient limitation and relatively constant marine biodiversity during the rest of the Paleozoic. Given the slow nutrient inputs from land and low recycling rates, the growth of early-to-middle Paleozoic metazoans remained limited by their having to expend energy to first "burn off" (respire) excess carbon in food before the associated nutrients could be utilized for growth and reproduction; the relative equilibrium in marine biodiversity during the Paleozoic therefore appears to be real. Limited nutrient availability and the consequent nutrient imbalance may have delayed the appearance of more advanced carnivores until the Permo-Carboniferous, when widespread orogeny, falling sea level, the spread of forests, greater weathering rates, enhanced ocean circulation, oxygenation, and upwelling all combined to increase nutrient availability. During the Meso-Cenozoic, rising oxygen levels, the continued nutrient input from land, and, especially, increasing rates of bioturbation, OPEN ACCESS enhanced nutrient availability, increasing the nutrient content of phytoplankton that fueled the diversification of the Modern Fauna. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = { The long-term temperature response to a given change in CO 2 forcing, or Earth-system sensitivity (ESS), is a key parameter quantifying our understanding about the relationship between changes in Earth's radiative forcing and the resulting long-term Earth-system response. Current ESS estimates are subject to sizable uncertainties. Long-term carbon cycle models can provide a useful avenue to constrain ESS, but previous efforts either use rather informal statistical approaches or focus on discrete paleoevents. Here, we improve on previous ESS estimates by using a Bayesian approach to fuse deep-time CO 2 and temperature data over the last 420 Myrs with a long-term carbon cycle model. Our median ESS estimate of 3.4 °C (2.6-4.7 °C; 5-95% range) shows a narrower range than previous assessments. We show that weaker chemical weathering relative to the a priori model configuration via reduced weatherable land area yields better agreement with temperature records during the Cretaceous. Research into improving the understanding about these weathering mechanisms hence provides potentially powerful avenues to further constrain this fundamental Earth-system property. },

abstract = {Organismic groups vary non-randomly in their vulnerability to extinction. However, it is unclear whether the same groups are consistently vulnerable, regardless of the dominant extinction drivers, or whether certain drivers have their own distinctive and predictable victims. Given the challenges presented by anthropogenic global warming, we focus on changes in extinction selectivity trends during ancient hyperthermal events: geologically rapid episodes of global warming. Focusing on the fossil record of the last 300 million years, we identify clades and traits of marine ectotherms that were more prone to extinction under the onset of six hyperthermal events than during other times. Hyperthermals enhanced the vulnerability of marine fauna that host photosymbionts, particularly zooxanthellate corals, the reef environments they provide, and genera with actively burrowing or swimming adult life-stages. The extinction risk of larger sized fauna also increased relative to non-hyperthermal times, while genera with a poorly buffered internal physiology did not become more vulnerable on average during hyperthermals. Hyperthermal-vulnerable clades include rhynchonelliform brachiopods and bony fish, whereas resistant clades include cartilaginous fish, and ostreid and venerid bivalves. These extinction responses in the geological past mirror modern responses of these groups to warming, including range-shift magnitudes, population losses, and experimental performance under climate-related stressors. Accordingly, extinction mechanisms distinctive to rapid global warming may be indicated, including sensitivity to warming-induced seawater deoxygenation. In anticipation of modern warming-driven marine extinctions, the trends illustrated in the fossil record offer an expedient preview.},

abstract = {It is well known that functional diversity strongly affects ecosystem functioning. However, even in rather simple model communities consisting of only two or, at best, three trophic levels, the relationship between multitrophic functional diversity and ecosystem functioning appears difficult to generalize, due to its high contex-tuality. In this study, we considered several differently structured tritrophic food webs, in which the amount of functional diversity was varied independently on each trophic level. To achieve generalizable results, largely independent of parametriza-tion, we examined the outcomes of 128, 000 parameter combinations sampled from ecologically plausible intervals, with each tested for 200 randomly sampled initial conditions. Analysis of our data was done by training a Random Forest model. This method enables the identification of complex patterns in the data through partial dependence graphs, and the comparison of the relative influence of model parameters, including the degree of diversity, on food web properties. We found that the effects of functional diversity on any trophic level are intimately linked to the amount of diversity on other trophic levels, which may explain the difficulty in unifying results from previous studies. Strikingly, with high diversity throughout the whole food web, different interactions synergize to ensure efficient exploitation of the available nutrients and efficient biomass transfer, ultimately leading to a high biomass and production on the top level. The temporal variation of biomass showed a more complex pattern with increasing multitrophic diversity: while the system initially became less variable, eventually the temporal variation rose again due to the increasingly complex dynamical patterns. Importantly, top diversity and food web parameters affecting the top level were of highest importance to determine the biomass and temporal variability of any trophic level. Therefore, given its high ecological importance and vulnerability to global change, it is essential to preserve diversity on the top trophic level.},

abstract = {Sedimentary-exhalative (sedex) ore deposits were formed by discharge of metal-rich brines into ancient ocean basins. Chemical, isotopic, and geologic data from several Paleozoic sedex districts suggest that the brine discharges also supplied enormous quantities of radiogenic Sr and biolimiting nutrients to the oceans. Seven middle Paleozoic sedex events appear to coincide with short-duration positive excursions (“spikes”) in the global marine Sr-isotope record that are not explained by current oceanic models. These strong temporal correlations, combined with mass balance evidence and oceanographic modeling, suggest the flux of radiogenic Sr-rich sedex brines may have been sufficient to cause these prominent spikes. If these sedex hydrothermal events are recorded in the secular record, then the 87Sr/86Sr record may provide a unique tool for ore genesis studies and for assessing the mineral potential of sedimentary basins of different ages. The apex of these enigmatic 87Sr/86Sr spikes correlate with global $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O spikes, periods of global anoxia, deposition of metal-rich black shales, deposition of ironstones, climate change, metal-induced malformation (teratology) of marine organisms and significant mass extinctions. While the relationships among these phenomena remain poorly understood and diverse models for these events have been proposed, most invoke an increased flux of biolimiting nutrients resulting in ocean eutrophication. Evidence that the flux of key biolimiting nutrients and metals contained in sedex brines may have been equivalent to or surpass that of the total modern riverine flux to the ocean suggests that these sedex brine exhalations may have triggered global chemical and biological events.},

abstract = {The evolution of Earth's atmosphere is of extreme importance to the lithosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. This is particularly true for the role the biosphere played in the inceptual formation of atmospheric oxygen, and subsequently in its potential role in the evolution of higher life forms. Quantifying the change in atmospheric oxygen with geologic time is extremely challenging, with the redox sensitive isotope and element models subject to contradictory outcomes. Here, we present a new approach in determining past atmospheres, by a) directly measuring (DM) the amount of atmospheric oxygen trapped in fluid-gas inclusions of primary and unaltered halite, and by b) using a back-calculation method (BCM) applied to trapped halite fluid inclusion gas contents subjected to post-depositional biogeochemical reactions to calculate the amount of atmospheric oxygen. On average (±standard error), atmospheric oxygen content during the latest Ediacaran was 17.4 ± 2.1% compiled from DM of 17.4 ± 1.3% and from BCM of 17.3 ± 2.9%. For the earliest Cambrian average oxygen was 19.3 ± 1.4% compiled from DM of 18.8 ± 1.5% and from BCM of 19.8 ± 1.3%. The oxygen content during the mid and late Ordovician was relatively invariant with 15.6 ± 1.8% [15.4 ± 1.4% (DM), 15.8 ± 2.2% (BCM)], and 16.2 ± 1.2% [15.7 ± 1.7% (DM), 16.6 ± 0.7% (BCM)], respectively. The relatively stable atmospheric oxygen levels continued into the Silurian of 15.9 ± 1.1% (12.9 ± 0.4 to 16.5%, DM; 14.3 ± 1.7 to 19.8 ± 2.1% BCM) except for a peak to about present levels during the late Silurian of 23.2 ± 1.9% (21.6% DM, 24.7 ± 3.7% BCM). Early Carboniferous atmospheric oxygen returned to relatively lower and invariant levels at about 15.3 ± 0.7 to 15.7 ± 1.0% (15.0%, 15.5 ± 0.1% DM, 9.4 ± 3.9 to 15.8 ± 1.9% BCM). Similarly, the average atmospheric oxygen content in fluid inclusion of halites from the late Permian was similar with 15.7 ± 1.3% with 16.9% (DM) to 14.5 ± 2.6% (BCM). Indeed, our study suggests that atmospheric oxygen was relatively constant for most of the Paleozoic at about 16.5% (±0.6 SE, ±2.2 SD). This puts our proxy result at odds with the values and trends suggested by the COPSE, GEOCARBSULF AND GEOCARBSULFOR models for the early Paleozoic atmospheric oxygen, and continues the discord with the GEOCARBSULF and GEOCARBULFOR models during the late Paleozoic.},

abstract = {Variations in atmosphere oxygen and ocean sulfate concentrations through time are regarded as important controls on the cycles of sediment-hosted and volcanic-hosted ore deposits. However, estimates of atmosphere oxygen in the Proterozoic have been frustrated by the lack of a direct measurement method and conflicting evidence from various proposed geochemical proxies. Studies in the 1970s to 1990s suggested a relatively oxygenated atmosphere (> 3 wt% O2) in the Proterozoic. However, since the late 1990s, new proxies and modelling have suggested very much lower levels of oxygen (< 0.02 wt% O2). Focusing on redox-sensitive trace elements, here we combine a dataset of over 3000 LA-ICP-MS trace-element analyses on sedimentary pyrite, standardised against Berner'sPhanerozoic O2 modelling and direct measurement of oxygen concentrations in fluid inclusions in sedimentary halite, to develop the first detailed estimate for atmosphere O2 concentration and secular variation from 2200 Ma to the present. The estimates suggest dynamic cycles of atmosphere oxygen that increased in frequency through time. There were possibly three first-order cycles in the Proterozoic varying from 400 to 600 million years in length and a further five first-order cycles in the Phanerozoic from 60 to 120 million years in length. Our estimates of oxygen concentration are at odds with most previous estimates. We suggest, rather than very low atmosphere oxygen in the Proterozoic, the mean concentration was about 7 wt%, rising to a mean of about 10 wt% in the Phanerozoic, but with significant cyclic variation of up to a maximum concentration of possibly over 30 wt%. We observe that the proposed oxygen cycles correlate with biodiversity cycles and to the timing of major stratiform base-metal deposits in sedimentary basins. For example, minima in atmosphere oxygenation correlate with mass extinction events and stratiform Zn–Pb–Ag deposits, whereas maxima in oxygenation correlate with major evolutionary events, global periods of evaporite formation and the timing of stratiform copper deposits.},

These are the first measurements of inclusion gas for the Neoproterozoic obtained from 815 ± 15-m.y.-old Browne Formation chevron halite of the Officer Basin, southwest Australia. The 31 gas measurements afford us a direct glimpse of the composition of the mid-to late Neoproterozoic atmosphere and register an average oxygen content of 10.9%. The measured pO2 puts oxygenation of Earth's paleoatmosphere $\sim$100-200 m.y. ahead of current models and proxy studies.

abstract = {Patterns of change in the isotope composition of sulfur-bearing minerals play a key role in reconstructing the marine sulfur cycle. Determining marine sulfate concentration, in particular, is critical to understanding the linkages between oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans, and the history of life. Much of our current understanding of marine oxygenation relies on a traditional single reservoir model, wherein the isotopic composition of marine sulfate is controlled primarily by burial of sedimentary pyrite. Utility of this model is limited, however, during times of persistent marine euxinia, which marks a fundamental decoupling between oxic and anoxic marine sulfur reservoirs. At these times, short-term fluxes that act between the two reservoirs (e.g., sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation processes) often dominate over the long term fluxes (e.g., weathering and pyrite burial) that control the single reservoir ocean model. Ordovician strata from Argentina, western Newfoundland, and South China illustrate how the marine sulfur cycle is affected by the presence of a persistent euxinic reservoir. Regional euxinic reservoirs remain generally stable from the Floian through the Dapingian, despite evidence for periodic short-term oxygenation events. Dramatic reorganization of the marine sulfur cycle in the early Darriwilian, however, reflects dynamic disequilibrium between oxic and anoxic (euxinic) marine reservoirs, driven by ocean ventilation. Ventilation resulted in a rapid change in the isotopic composition of marine sulfate in surface oceans, and ultimately led to the near depletion of hydrogen sulfide within the anoxic reservoir, as marked by formation of superheavy pyrite. Ventilation occurred coincident with a decline in sea surface temperatures and may represent the onset of climatic change that ultimately led to late Ordovician glaciation.},

abstract = {Oxygen deprivation and hydrogen sulfide toxicity are considered potent kill mechanisms during the mass extinction just before the Permian–Triassic boundary ($\sim$251.9 million years ago). However, the mechanism that drove vast stretches of the ocean to an anoxic state is unclear. Here, we present palaeoredox and phosphorus speciation data for a marine bathymetric transect from Svalbard. This shows that, before the extinction, enhanced weathering driven by Siberian Traps volcanism increased the influx of phosphorus, thus enhancing marine primary productivity and oxygen depletion in proximal shelf settings. However, this non-sulfidic state efficiently sequestered phosphorus in the sediment in association with iron minerals, thus restricting the intensity and spatial extent of oxygen-depleted waters. The collapse of vegetation on land immediately before the marine extinction changed the relative weathering influx of iron and sulfate. The resulting transition to euxinic (sulfidic) conditions led to enhanced remobilization of bioavailable phosphorus, initiating a feedback that caused the spread of anoxic waters across large portions of the shelf. This reconciles a lag of >0.3 million years between the onset of enhanced weathering and the development of widespread, but geographically variable, ocean anoxia, with major implications for extinction selectivity.},

abstract = {The composition of continental crust records the balance between construction by tectonics and destruction by physical and chemical erosion. Quantitative constraints on how igneous addition and chemical weathering have modified the continents' bulk composition are essential for understanding the evolution of geodynamics and climate. Using novel data analytic techniques we have extracted temporal trends in sediments' protolith composition and weathering intensity from the largest available compilation of sedimentary major element compositions: ∼15,000 samples from 4.0 Ga to the present. We find that the average Archean upper continental crust was silica-rich and had a similar compositional diversity to modern continents. This is consistent with an early Archean, or earlier, onset of plate tectonics. In the Archean, chemical weathering sequestered ∼25 % more CO2 per mass eroded for the same weathering intensity than in subsequent time periods, consistent with carbon mass balance despite higher Archean outgassing rates and more limited continental exposure. Since 2.0 Ga, over long (>0.5 Gyr) timescales, crustal weathering intensity has remained relatively constant. On shorter timescales over the Phanerozoic, weathering intensity is correlated to global climate state, consistent with a weathering feedback acting in response to changes in CO2 sources or sinks.},

abstract = {The middle to later Cambrian (Drumian-Jiangshanian Ages, 505–490 Ma) was a time of unique evolutionary dynamics that remain enigmatic. This interval records unusually high rates of faunal turnover that produced a “plateau” within the broader trajectory of rapidly increasing biodiversity seen across the Cambrian Explosion and Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE). The oceans during this time are generally thought to have been less oxygenated than later in the Phanerozoic, yet knowledge of oceanic redox structure and the influence this exerted upon the biosphere remains limited. Importantly, this interval also encompasses two large carbon cycle perturbations—the DICE and SPICE events— that are thought to involve the expansion of anoxic and, more specifically euxinic regions in the ocean. Despite this supposition, direct characterization of redox conditions across this time remains limited. Here we explore these conditions using new and previously published Fe-speciation data from seven basins distributed across five paleocontinents representing a range of depositional conditions. Our analysis reveals anoxia was a common and persistent feature of deeper-water environments and that it was generally absent from shallower-waters across this timespan. An exception to this broad pattern is seen during the SPICE when these deeper-water anoxic conditions expanded into shallower-water environments. These anoxic conditions were dominantly ferruginous and rare instances of euxinia were spatiotemporally limited to environments of high productivity, low clastic sedimentation and high sulfate availability within a generally low-sulfate ocean. Intriguingly, during these events faunal turnover was concentrated in inner-shelf areas suggesting a mechanistic link to the variable redox conditions characteristic of these environments. More broadly this instability in nearshore environments appears a likely cause of the high rates of faunal turnover seen across the later Cambrian and into the Early Ordovician, but further detailed paleontological and redox investigation of these environments are needed to adequately evaluate this view.},

abstract = {Diversity plays a key role in the adaptive capacity of marine ecosystems to environmental changes. However, modelling the adaptive dynamics of phytoplankton traits remains challenging due to the competitive exclusion of suboptimal phenotypes and the complexity of evolutionary processes leading to optimal phenotypes. Trait diffusion (TD) is a recently developed approach to sustain diversity in plankton models by introducing mutations, therefore allowing the adaptive evolution of functional traits to occur at ecological timescales. In this study, we present a model called Simulating Plankton Evolution with Adaptive Dynamics (SPEAD) that resolves the eco-evolutionary processes of a multi-trait plankton community. The SPEAD model can be used to evaluate plankton adaptation to environmental changes at different timescales or address ecological issues affected by adaptive evolution. Phytoplankton phenotypes in SPEAD are characterized by two traits, the nitrogen half-saturation constant and optimal temperature, which can mutate at each generation using the TD mechanism. SPEAD does not resolve the different phenotypes as discrete entities, instead computing six aggregate properties: total phytoplankton biomass, the mean value of each trait, trait variances, and the intertrait covariance of a single population in a continuous trait space. Therefore, SPEAD resolves the dynamics of the population's continuous trait distribution by solving its statistical moments, wherein the variances of trait values represent the diversity of ecotypes. The ecological model is coupled to a vertically resolved (1D) physical environment, and therefore the adaptive dynamics of the simulated phytoplankton population are driven by seasonal variations in vertical mixing, nutrient concentration, water temperature, and solar irradiance. The simulated bulk properties are validated by observations from Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Studies (BATS) in the Sargasso Sea. We find that moderate mutation rates sustain trait diversity at decadal timescales and soften the almost total inter-trait correlation induced by the environment alone, without reducing the annual primary production or promoting permanently maladapted phenotypes, as occur with high mutation rates. As a way to evaluate the performance of the continuous trait approximation, we also compare the solutions of SPEAD to the solutions of a classical discrete entities approach, with both approaches including TD as a mechanism to sustain trait variance. We only find minor discrepancies between the continuous model SPEAD and the discrete model, with the computational cost of SPEAD being lower by 2 orders of magnitude. Therefore, SPEAD should be an ideal eco-evolutionary plankton model to be coupled to a general circulation model (GCM) of the global ocean.},

abstract = {Modeling the long-term transient evolution of climate remains a technical and scientific challenge. However, understanding and improved modeling of the long-term behavior of the climate system increases confidence in projected changes in the mid- to long-term future. Energy balance models (EBMs) provide simplified and computationally efficient descriptions of long timescales and allow large ensemble runs by parameterizing energy fluxes. This way, they can be used to pinpoint periods and phenomena of interest. Here, we present an extended version of the two-dimensional energy balance model by Zhuang et al. (2017a). Transient CO2, solar insolation, orbital configuration, fixed ice coverage and land-sea distribution are implemented as effective radiative forcings at the land surface. We show that the model is most sensitive to changes in CO2 and ice distribution, but the obliquity and land-sea mask have significant influence on modeled temperatures as well. We tune the new model to reproduce the 1960–89 C.E. global mean temperature, equator-to-pole, and seasonal temperature gradient of the ERA20CM reanalysis (Hersbach et al., 2015). The resulting latitudinal and seasonal temperature distributions agree well with reanalysis and the general circulation model (GCM) HadCM3 for a simulation of the past millennium. We find that the EBM lacks internal climatic variability. This is attributed mostly to its reduced descriptions of heat transport and the hydrological cycle. As the model facilitates long transient simulations, we envisage its use in exploratory studies of stochastic forcing and perturbed parameterizations, thus complementing studies with comprehensive GCMs.},

abstract = {To improve estimates of the extent of ocean oxygenation during the late Ediacaran Period, we measured the U and Mo isotope compositions of euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) organic-rich mudrocks (ORM) of Member IV, upper Doushantuo Formation, South China. The average $\delta$238U of most samples is 0.24±0.16‰ (2SD; relative to standard CRM145), which is slightly higher than the average $\delta$238U of 0.02±0.12‰ for restricted Black Sea (deep-water Unit I) euxinic sediments and is similar to a modeled $\delta$238U value of 0.2‰ for open ocean euxinic sediments in the modern well-oxygenated oceans. Because 238U is preferentially removed to euxinic sediments compared to 235U, expanded ocean anoxia will deplete seawater of 238U relative to 235U, ultimately leading to deposition of ORM with low $\delta$238U. Hence, the high $\delta$238U of Member IV ORM points to a common occurrence of extensive ocean oxygenation ca. 560 to 551 Myr ago.The Mo isotope composition of sediments deposited from strongly euxinic bottom waters ([H2S]aq >11$\mu$M) either directly records the global seawater Mo isotope composition (if Mo removal from deep waters is quantitative) or represents a minimum value for seawater (if Mo removal is not quantitative). Near the top of Member IV, $\delta$98Mo approaches the modern seawater value of 2.34±0.10‰. High $\delta$98Mo points to widespread ocean oxygenation because the preferential removal of isotopically light Mo to sediments occurs to a greater extent in O2-rich compared to O2-deficient marine environments. However, the $\delta$98Mo value for most Member IV ORM is near 0‰ (relative to standard NIST SRM 3134=0.25‰), suggesting extensive anoxia. The low $\delta$98Mo is at odds with the high Mo concentrations of Member IV ORM, which suggest a large seawater Mo inventory in well-oxygenated oceans, and the high $\delta$238U. Hence, we propose that the low $\delta$98Mo of most Member IV ORM was fractionated from contemporaneous seawater. Possible mechanisms driving this isotope fractionation include: (1) inadequate dissolved sulfide for quantitative thiomolybdate formation and capture of a seawater-like $\delta$98Mo signature in sediments or (2) delivery of isotopically light Mo to sediments via a particulate Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide shuttle.A compilation of Mo isotope data from euxinic ORM suggests that there were transient episodes of extensive ocean oxygenation that break up intervals of less oxygenated oceans during late Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic time. Hence, Member IV does not capture irreversible deep ocean oxygenation. Instead, complex ocean redox variations likely marked the transition from O2-deficient Proterozoic oceans to widely oxygenated later Phanerozoic oceans.},

abstract = {We present several equilibrium runs under varying atmospheric CO2 concentrations using the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM). The model shows two very different responses: for CO2 concentrations of 400 ppm or lower, the system evolves into an equilibrium state. For CO2 concentrations of 440 ppm or higher, the system starts oscillating between a state with vigorous deep water formation in the Southern Ocean and a state with no deep water formation in the Southern Ocean. The flushing events result in a rapid increase in atmospheric temperatures, degassing of CO2 and therefore an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and a reduction of sea ice cover in the Southern Ocean. They also cool the deep ocean worldwide. After the flush, the deep ocean warms slowly again and CO2 is taken up by the ocean until the stratification becomes unstable again at high latitudes thousands of years later. The existence of a threshold in CO2 concentration which places the UVic ESCM in either an oscillating or non-oscillating state makes our results intriguing. If the UVic ESCM captures a mechanism that is present and important in the real climate system, the consequences would comprise a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of several tens of ppm, an increase in global surface temperature of the order of 1-2°C, local temperature changes of the order of 6°C and a profound change in ocean stratification, deep water temperature and sea ice cover. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

Here, we present a continuous pCO2 record across the PTME reconstructed from high-resolution $\delta$13C of C3 plants from southwestern China.

However, the relationship between these variables and extinction risk has not been tested extensively during evolutionarily quiescent times of low extinction and speciation in the fossil record. Here we examine the influence of geographic range size and abundance on extinction risk during the late Paleozoic (Mississippian-Permian), a time of sluggish evolution when global rates of origination and extinction were roughly half those of other Paleozoic intervals. Analyses used spatiotemporal occurrences for 164 brachiopod species from the North American midcontinent. We found abundance to be a better predictor of extinction risk than measures of geographic range size. Moreover, species exhibited reductions in abundance before their extinction but did not display contractions in geographic range size. The weak relationship between geographic range size and extinction in this time and place may reflect the relative preponderance of larger-ranged taxa combined with the physiographic conditions of the region that allowed for easy habitat tracking that dampened both extinction and speciation. These conditions led to a prolonged period (19-25 Myr) during which standard macroevolutionary rules did not apply.},

abstract = {A latitudinal gradient in biodiversity has existed since before the time of the dinosaurs, yet how and why this gradient arose remains unresolved. Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Energy balance models (EBMs) are highly simplified models of the climate system, providing admissible conceptual tools for understanding climate changes. The global temperature is calculated by the radiation budget through the incoming energy from the Sun and the outgoing energy from the Earth. The argument that the temperature can be calculated by this simple radiation budget is revisited. The underlying assumption for a realistic temperature distribution is explored: one has to assume a moderate diurnal cycle due to the large heat capacity and the fast rotation of the Earth. Interestingly, the global mean in the revised EBM is very close to the originally proposed value. The main point is that the effective heat capacity and its temporal variation over the daily and seasonal cycle needs to be taken into account when estimating surface temperature from the energy budget. Furthermore, the time-dependent EBM predicts a flat meridional temperature gradient for large heat capacities, reducing the seasonal cycle and the outgoing radiation and increasing global temperature. Motivated by this finding, a sensitivity experiment with a complex model is performed where the vertical diffusion in the ocean has been increased. The resulting temperature gradient, reduced seasonal cycle, and global warming is also found in climate reconstructions, providing a possible mechanism for past climate changes prior to 3 million years ago.},

We show that the large short-lived Hg spike, and nadirs in $\delta$202Hg and $\delta$13C values at the marine PTME are best explained by a sudden, massive pulse of terrestrial biomass oxidation, while volcanism remains an adequate explanation for the longer-term geochemical changes.

abstract = {Aim: Despite the generality of the latitudinal gradient of species diversity (LDG) phenomenon, there is growing evidence showing deviations from an idealized pattern, that is, a single peak of species richness symmetrically centred in the Equator, but the underlying causes remain little studied. We here evaluate the existence of departures from the idealized LDG in a group of marine crustaceans and the explanatory role of environmental variables. Location: Coastal shelf (<200 m depth) along the Western Atlantic coast (46°N–47°S). Taxon: Burrowing shrimps (Decapoda: Axiidea and Gebiidea). Methods: We assessed the shape of the LDG in 100 burrowing shrimp species using the reported latitudinal ranges of distribution. Species richness was calculated in one-degree latitude bands using a range-through approach. The shape of the LDG was statistically evaluated in terms of latitudinal symmetry, number of modes and location. We evaluated the importance of 10 environmental variables (proxies of different hypothesis categories) predicting the LDG using a random forest model. Results: Burrowing shrimps exhibit an increase in diversity towards the tropics, but departures to the idealized LDG were evident. The LDG is asymmetric between hemispheres and bimodal (two peaks within the tropics), and this trend cannot be explained in terms of sampling artifacts. A random forest model explains 92% of species richness, but the only significant variables were bottom seawater temperature, bottom seawater salinity, bottom seawater temperature range, and tidal range. These predictors were nonlinearly related to species richness, whereas only bottom seawater temperature and bottom seawater salinity showed a significant phylogenetic signal. Main conclusions: The LDG of burrowing shrimps is driven by ecophysiological restrictions of species, reflecting the role of evolutionary (i.e. ‘time for species accumulation' and/or ‘diversification dynamics') and ecological processes (i.e. ‘ecological limits'). Departures from the idealized LDG could be explained by the nonlinear responses of species richness to environmental conditions, the spatial structure of these environmental conditions, and a varying degree of phylogenetic conservatism of key ecophysiological constraints.},

abstract = {As anthropogenic forcing continues to rapidly modify worldwide climate, impacts on landscape changes will grow. Olivine weathering is a natural process that sequesters carbon out of the atmosphere, but is now being proposed as a strategy that can be artificially implemented to assist in the mitigation of anthropogenic carbon emissions. We use the landscape evolution model Badlands to identify a region (Tweed Caldera catchment in Eastern Australia) that has the potential for naturally enhanced supply of mafic sediments, known to be a carbon sink, into coastal environments. Although reality is more complex than what can be captured within a model, our models have the ability to unravel and estimate how erosion of volcanic edifices and landscape dynamics will react to future climate change projections. Local climate projections were taken from the Australian government and the IPCC in the form of four alternative pathways. Three additional scenarios were designed, with added contributions from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, to better understand how the landscape/dynamics might be impacted by an increase in sea level rise due to ice sheet tipping points being hit. Three scenarios were run with sea level held constant and precipitation rates increased in order to better understand the role that precipitation and sea level plays in the regional supply of sediment. Changes between scenarios are highly dependent upon the rate and magnitude of climatic change. We estimate the volume of mafic sediment supplied to the erosive environment within the floodplain (ranging from ∼27 to 30 million m3 by 2100 and ∼78–315 million m3 by 2500), the average amount of olivine within the supplied sediment under the most likely scenarios (∼7.6 million m3 by 2100 and ∼30 million m3 by 2500), and the amount of CO2 that is subsequently sequestered (∼53–73 million tons by 2100 and ∼206–284 million tons by 2500). Our approach not only identifies a region that can be further studied in order to evaluate the efficacy and impact of enhanced silicate weathering driven by climate change, but can also help identify other regions that have a natural ability to act as a carbon sink via mafic rock weathering.},

abstract = {The Paris Agreement 1 aims to address the gap between existing climate policies and policies consistent with "holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 C". The feasibility of meeting the target has been questioned both in terms of the possible requirement for negative emissions 2 and ongoing debate on the sensitivity of the climate-carbon-cycle system 3. Using a sequence of ensembles of a fully dynamic three-dimensional climate-carbon-cycle model, forced by emissions from an integrated assessment model of regional-level climate policy, economy, and technological transformation, we show that a reasonable interpretation of the Paris Agreement is still technically achievable. Specifically, limiting peak (decadal) warming to less than 1.7 °C, or end-of-century warming to less than 1.54 °C, occurs in 50% of our simulations in a policy scenario without net negative emissions or excessive stringency in any policy domain. We evaluate two mitigation scenarios, with 200 gigatonnes of carbon and 307 gigatonnes of carbon post-2017 emissions respectively, quantifying the spatio-temporal variability of warming, precipitation, ocean acidification and marine productivity. Under rapid decarbonization decadal variability dominates the mean response in critical regions, with significant implications for decision-making, demanding impact methodologies that address non-linear spatio-temporal responses. Ignoring carbon-cycle feedback uncertainties (which can explain 47% of peak warming uncertainty) becomes unreasonable under strong mitigation conditions.},

However, the dynamics of plume-induced subductions, their lifetime and their ability to propagate at the scale of an entire ocean remain unknown. Here, we combine a quantitative synthesis of the ophiolitic record of the Neotethys subduction in the Late Cretaceous with 3D spherical modeling of mantle convection self-generating plate-like tectonics to propose that the pre-Deccan plume initiated the Southern Neotethys Subduction. We suggest that this subduction retreated at 5-10 cm yr−1 until it reached the continental margins of Arabia and India. The sequential segmentation of this subduction during its retreat and the diachronous deactivation of the resulting segments drove the Late Cretaceous-Eocene series of plate reorganization events recorded in the Indian Ocean's fabric.},

abstract = {We examine how the history of Phanerozoic marine biodiversity relates to environmental change. Our focus is on North America, which has a relatively densely sampled history. By transforming time series into the time-frequency domain using wavelets, histories of biodiversity are shown to be similar to sea level, temperature and oceanic chemistry at multiple timescales. Fluctuations in sea level play an important role in driving Phanerozoic biodiversity at timescales >50 Myr, and during finite intervals at shorter periods. Subsampled and transformed marine genera time series reinforce the idea that Permian-Triassic, Triassic-Jurassic, and Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinctions were geologically rapid, whereas the Ordovician-Silurian and Late Devonian ‘events' were longer lived. High cross wavelet power indicates that biodiversity is most similar to environmental variables (sea level, plate fragmentation, $\delta$ 18 O, $\delta$ 13 C, $\delta$ 34 S and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) at periods >200 Myr, when they are broadly in phase (i.e. no time lag). They are also similar at shorter periods for finite durations of time (e.g. during some mass extinctions). These results suggest that long timescale processes (e.g. plate kinematics) are the primary drivers of biodiversity, whilst processes with significant variability at shorter periods (e.g. glacio-eustasy, continental uplift and erosion, volcanism, asteroid impact) play a moderating role. Wavelet transforms are a useful approach for isolating information about times and frequencies of biological activity and commonalities with environmental variables.},

Although indicators of ocean de-oxygenation are common for the PETM, and linked to biotic turnover, the global extent and temporal progression of de-oxygenation is poorly constrained. Here we present carbonate associated uranium isotope data for the PETM. A lack of resolvable perturbation to the U-cycle during the event suggests a limited expansion of seafloor anoxia on a global scale. We use this result, in conjunction with a biogeochemical model, to set an upper limit on the extent of global seafloor de-oxygenation. The model suggests that the new U isotope data, whilst also being consistent with plausible carbon emission scenarios and observations of carbon cycle recovery, permit a maximum $\sim$10-fold expansion of anoxia, covering <2% of seafloor area.},

In contrast to elsewhere, we show that anoxic non-sulfidic (ferruginous), rather than euxinic, conditions were prevalent in the Neo-Tethys.

abstract = {The Late Devonian was a protracted period of low speciation resulting in biodiversity decline, culminating in extinction events near the Devonian–Carboniferous boundary. Recent evidence indicates that the final extinction event may have coincided with a dramatic drop in stratospheric ozone, possibly due to a global temperature rise. Here we study an alternative possible cause for the postulated ozone drop: a nearby supernova explosion that could inflict damage by accelerating cosmic rays that can deliver ionizing radiation for up to ∼ 100 ky. We therefore propose that the end-Devonian extinctions were triggered by supernova explosions at ∼ 20 pc, somewhat beyond the “kill distance” that would have precipitated a full mass extinction. Such nearby supernovae are likely due to core collapses of massive stars; these are concentrated in the thin Galactic disk where the Sun resides. Detecting either of the long-lived radioisotopes 146Sm or 244Pu in one or more end-Devonian extinction strata would confirm a supernova origin, point to the core-collapse explosion of a massive star, and probe supernova nucleosynthesis. Other possible tests of the supernova hypothesis are discussed.},

Using a compilation of pCO2, pH, and calcite compensation depth (CCD) observational evidence and a suite of simulations, we reconcile long-term Cenozoic climate and CCD trends. We show that the CCD response was decoupled from changes in silicate and carbonate weathering rates, challenging the continental uplift hypothesis. The two dominant mechanisms for decoupling are shelf-basin carbonate burial fractionation combined with proliferation of pelagic calcifiers. The temperature effect on remineralization rates of marine organic matter also plays a critical role in controlling the carbon cycle dynamics, especially during the warmer periods of the Cenozoic.},

abstract = {Body size is central to ecology at levels ranging from organismal fecundity to the functioning of communities and ecosystems. Understanding temperature-induced variations in body size is therefore of fundamental and applied interest, yet thermal responses of body size remain poorly understood. Temperature–size (T–S) responses tend to be negative (e.g. smaller body size at maturity when reared under warmer conditions), which has been termed the temperature–size rule (TSR). Explanations emphasize either physiological mechanisms (e.g. limitation of oxygen or other resources and temperature-dependent resource allocation) or the adaptive value of either a large body size (e.g. to increase fecundity) or a short development time (e.g. in response to increased mortality in warm conditions). Oxygen limitation could act as a proximate factor, but we suggest it more likely constitutes a selective pressure to reduce body size in the warm: risks of oxygen limitation will be reduced as a consequence of evolution eliminating genotypes more prone to oxygen limitation. Thus, T–S responses can be explained by the ‘Ghost of Oxygen-limitation Past', whereby the resulting (evolved) T–S responses safeguard sufficient oxygen provisioning under warmer conditions, reflecting the balance between oxygen supply and demands experienced by ancestors. T–S responses vary considerably across species, but some of this variation is predictable. Body-size reductions with warming are stronger in aquatic taxa than in terrestrial taxa. We discuss whether larger aquatic taxa may especially face greater risks of oxygen limitation as they grow, which may be manifested at the cellular level, the level of the gills and the whole-organism level. In contrast to aquatic species, terrestrial ectotherms may be less prone to oxygen limitation and prioritize early maturity over large size, likely because overwintering is more challenging, with concomitant stronger end-of season time constraints. Mechanisms related to time constraints and oxygen limitation are not mutually exclusive explanations for the TSR. Rather, these and other mechanisms may operate in tandem. But their relative importance may vary depending on the ecology and physiology of the species in question, explaining not only the general tendency of negative T–S responses but also variation in T–S responses among animals differing in mode of respiration (e.g. water breathers versus air breathers), genome size, voltinism and thermally associated behaviour (e.g. heliotherms).},

We have assembled a database of the geographic ranges of 3,916 species of marine prosobranch gastropods living on the shelves of the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans, from the tropics to the Arctic Ocean. Western Atlantic and eastern Pacific diversities are similar, and the diversity gradients are strikingly similar despite many important physical and historical differences between the oceans. This shared diversity pattern cannot be explained by: (i) latitudinal differences in species range-length (Rapoport's rule); (ii) species-area effects; or (iii) recent geologic histories. One parameter that does correlate significantly with diversity in both oceans is solar energy input, as represented by average sea surface temperature. If this correlation is causal, sea surface temperature is probably linked to diversity through some aspect of productivity. In this case, diversity is an evolutionary outcome of trophodynamic processes inherent in ecosystems, and not just a byproduct of physical geographies.},

abstract = {The recovery time of marine productivity following the Cretaceous-Paleogene (KPg) mass extinction varies tremendously with location (hundreds to millions of years), with possible delays in the tropics as compared to higher latitudes. This heterogeneity is based on prevalent oligo- to mesotrophic marine environments. While highly productive eutrophic environments are less prevalent, they play a greater role in the carbon cycle. Here we present data from a eutrophic region within the tropical southern Tethys. Records of both organic matter and calcite production in this locality exhibit stability across the KPg boundary. In addition, our study points to a remarkably rapid recovery (<11 kyr), even possibly continuous high productivity across the KPg boundary, despite the tropical location. Moreover, the characteristic KPg $\delta$13C negative excursion is observed in our locality, but is independent of high productivity, possibly indicating a reduction in the $\delta$13C of the DIC of the ocean due to the input of light carbon from the atmosphere. Thus, this study provides new insight into the functioning of eutrophic ecosystems during environmental stress imposed by the ecological crisis.},

abstract = {The Global Coupled 3 (GC3) configuration of the Met Office Unified Model is presented. Among other applications, GC3 is the basis of the United Kingdom's submission to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). This paper documents the model components that make up the configuration (although the scientific descriptions of these components are in companion papers) and details the coupling between them. The performance of GC3 is assessed in terms of mean biases and variability in long climate simulations using present-day forcing. The suitability of the configuration for predictability on shorter time scales (weather and seasonal forecasting) is also briefly discussed. The performance of GC3 is compared against GC2, the previous Met Office coupled model configuration, and against an older configuration (HadGEM2-AO) which was the submission to CMIP5. In many respects, the performance of GC3 is comparable with GC2, however, there is a notable improvement in the Southern Ocean warm sea surface temperature bias which has been reduced by 75%, and there are improvements in cloud amount and some aspects of tropical variability. Relative to HadGEM2-AO, many aspects of the present-day climate are improved in GC3 including tropospheric and stratospheric temperature structure, most aspects of tropical and extratropical variability and top-of-atmosphere and surface fluxes. A number of outstanding errors are identified including a residual asymmetric sea surface temperature bias (cool northern hemisphere, warm Southern Ocean), an overly strong global hydrological cycle and insufficient European blocking.},

abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) has been directly estimated using reconstructions of past climates that are different than today's. A challenge to this approach is that temperature proxies integrate over the timescales of the fast feedback processes (e.g., changes in water vapor, snow, and clouds) that are captured in ECS as well as the slower feedback processes (e.g., changes in ice sheets and ocean circulation) that are not. A way around this issue is to treat the slow feedbacks as climate forcings and independently account for their impact on global temperature. Here we conduct a suite of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) simulations using the Community Earth System Model version 1.2 (CESM1.2) to quantify the forcing and efficacy of land ice sheets (LISs) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) in order to estimate ECS. Our forcing and efficacy quantification adopts the effective radiative forcing (ERF) and adjustment framework and provides a complete accounting for the radiative, topographic, and dynamical impacts of LIS on surface temperatures. ERF and efficacy of LGM LIS are <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula-3.2 W m<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula-2 and 1.1, respectively. The larger-than-unity efficacy is caused by the temperature changes over land and the Northern Hemisphere subtropical oceans which are relatively larger than those in response to a doubling of atmospheric <span classCombining double low line"inline-formulaCO2. The subtropical sea-surface temperature (SST) response is linked to LIS-induced wind changes and feedbacks in ocean-atmosphere coupling and clouds. ERF and efficacy of LGM GHG are <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula-2.8 W m<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula-2 and 0.9, respectively. The lower efficacy is primarily attributed to a smaller cloud feedback at colder temperatures. Our simulations further demonstrate that the direct ECS calculation using the forcing, efficacy, and temperature response in CESM1.2 overestimates the true value in the model by approximately 25 % due to the neglect of slow ocean dynamical feedback. This is supported by the greater cooling (6.8 C) in a fully coupled LGM simulation than that (5.3 C) in a slab ocean model simulation with ocean dynamics disabled. The majority (67 %) of the ocean dynamical feedback is attributed to dynamical changes in the Southern Ocean, where interactions between upper-ocean stratification, heat transport, and sea-ice cover are found to amplify the LGM cooling. Our study demonstrates the value of climate models in the quantification of climate forcings and the ocean dynamical feedback, which is necessary for an accurate direct ECS estimation.},

abstract = {It is important to understand how Earth's surface conditions have changed over geological timescales and what has driven these changes. Much of this understanding comes from combining geological and geochemical data with global biogeochemical models, but designing and running computer models over these vast timeframes poses a serious challenge. Traditionally one must choose between running a climate-enabled model for sets of shorter-term scenarios or running a dimensionless ‘box' model for long periods, but with a poor representation of climate. In this paper we introduce a method to run a climate-enabled biogeochemical model over Phanerozoic timescales: which we term Spatial Continuous Integration (SCION). This approach combines two key methods in the literature, which form the basis of the ‘GEOCLIM' and ‘COPSE' models respectively, and the resulting model is able to compute whole-Phanerozoic linked climate and biogeochemistry, as well as outputting geochemical isotope tracers to aid in hypothesis testing. This new model differs from GEOCLIM because it is able to run continuously over the whole Phanerozoic, and it differs from COPSE by having a spatial representation of climate and continental processes. Spatial representation of climate allows for detailed approximations of surface weathering processes through changes in temperature, erosion and runoff, and the SCION predictions for atmospheric CO2 variations over Phanerozoic time show better agreement with data than predictions from nondimensional models. Despite this, several inconsistencies remain with the geological record, most notably the inability of the model to reproduce transient late Ordovician cooling, and general over-estimation of CO2 levels during the Paleozoic. These discrepancies may be addressed in future work by including a scheme for positioning of highly-weatherable volcanic terranes, and by better capturing the behaviour of the terrestrial biosphere. The model approach we outline here is ideally suited for expansion to include these aspects.},

abstract = {The Phanerozoic evolution of the atmospheric CO2 level is controlled by the fluxes entering or leaving the exospheric system. In this contribution, we focus on the role played by the palaeogeographic configuration on the efficiency of the CO2 sink by continental silicate weathering, and on the impact of the magmatic degassing of CO2. We use the spatially resolved numerical model GEOCLIM to compute the response of the silicate weathering and atmospheric CO2 to continental drift for 22 time slices of the Phanerozoic. Regarding the CO2 released by the magmatic activity, we reconstruct several Phanerozoic histories of this flux, based on published indices. Again using the GEOCLIM model, we calculate the CO2 evolution for each degassing scenario. We show that the palaeogeographic setting is a main driver of the climate from 540 Ma to about the beginning of the Jurassic, with the noticeable exception of the Late Palaeozoic ice age. Regarding the role of the magmatic degassing, the various reconstructions do not converge towards a single signal, and thus introduce large uncertainties in the calculated CO2 level over time. Nevertheless, the continental dispersion, which prevails since the Jurassic, promotes CO2 consumption by weathering and forces atmospheric CO2 to stay low. Warm climates of the 'middle' Cretaceous and early Cenozoic require enhanced CO2 degassing by magmatic activity.},

abstract = {This work presents two examples of palaeobiogeographic reconstruction using the Interactive Data Language{\textregistered} (IDL). Although this meta-language is devoted to geoscientists and offers an array of easily usable tools, few palaeontologists actually use it. Our purpose is to illustrate how the IDL can be used to generate clear and direct visualizations of simulation results and interpolation methods for personal Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The first example is a paleogeographic simulation of the biodiversity evolution of planktonic species (and especially ammonoids) in the Early Triassic. Principal results of this global scale simulation are that the formation of a marine latitudinal gradient of species richness depends on the shape and magnitude of the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) gradient, and the geographic location of the group's ancestor. Thus, the recovery pattern of Early Triassic ammonoids species richness can be simulated and explained by a general increasing trend in steepness of the SST gradient. The second example describes a custom-designed GIS for large European Neogene continental mammals. Species richness and ecomorphologic parameters are interpolated, monitored in several ways, and discussed. Comparisons with the present-day distribution of large European mammals are also drawn and allow us to recognize that a broad North/South aridity gradient already existed by the Late Miocene with more open environments in Southern Europe.

abstract = {For several decades, the origin and ecological consequences of large-scale continental and marine Latitudinal Gradients of Taxonomic Richness (LGTR) have been intensively debated. Among the various hypotheses, it has been proposed that a LGTR is the by-product of a geographic mid-domain effect, i.e. the result of a random distribution of ranges of taxa between physical hard boundaries such as the continent/ocean interface. In order to more realistically evaluate the role of the mid-domain effect on the origin and evolution of the LGTR of marine planktonic organisms, we present a 2D model based on a cellular-automaton approach in which sea surface temperatures (SST) and currents are forced in the biogeographic dispersal of a randomly generated clade (a 2D 'geophyletic' model). Sensitivity experiments allow to evaluate the effects of currents, SST and the geographical origin of a clade on the formation and shape of a LGTR for planktonic organisms when coupled with a geographic mid-domain effect. Results are discussed in the light of the empirical LGTR of extant planktonic Foraminifera in the Atlantic Ocean. Independently of any other biotic or abiotic parameter, inclusive of the surface currents and origination/extinction absolute and relative rates, our simulations show that the coupling of the mid-domain effect with two critical parameters, namely the shape and intensity of the SST gradient and the geographic origin of a clade, produces realistic patterns of diversity when compared with the observed LGTR of extant atlantic planktonic foraminifera. The results illustrate a non-linear relation between a unimodal latitudinal SST gradient and a resulting bimodal LGTR characterized by a drop in species richness near the equator. This relation indicates that the SST gradient exerts a mid-domain effect on the LGTR. The latitudinal positions of the modal values of the LGTR are also found to be influenced by the geographic origin of the simulated clade. {\textcopyright} 2005 Blackwell Verlag.},

To test this 'law of constant extinction', we developed a new method using deep learning to infer age-dependent extinction and analysed 450 myr of marine life across 21 invertebrate clades. We show that extinction rate significantly decreases with age in > 90% of the cases, indicating that most species died out soon after their appearance while those which survived experienced ever decreasing extinction risk. This age-dependent extinction pattern is stronger towards the Equator and holds true when the potential effects of mass extinctions and taxonomic inflation are accounted for. These results suggest that the effect of biological interactions on age-dependent extinction rate is more intense towards the tropics. We propose that the latitudinal diversity gradient and selection at the species level account for this exceptional, yet little recognised, macroevolutionary and macroecological pattern.},

abstract = {7 Benthic oxygen isotope records are commonly used as a proxy for global mean surface temperatures 8 during the late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, and the resulting estimates have been extensively used in 9 characterising major trends and transitions in the climate system, and for analysing past climate 10 sensitivity. However, some fundamental assumptions governing this proxy have rarely been tested. 11 Two key assumptions are: (a) benthic foraminiferal temperatures are geographically well mixed and 12 are linked to surface high latitude temperatures, and (b) surface high latitude temperatures are well 13 correlated with global mean temperatures. To investigate the robustness of these assumptions 14 through geological time, we performed a series of 109 climate model simulations using a unique set 15 of paleogeographical reconstructions covering the entire Phanerozoic at the stage-level. The 16 simulations have been run for at least 5000 model years to ensure that the deep ocean is in dynamic 17 equilibrium. We find that the correlation between deep ocean temperatures and global mean 18 surface temperatures is good for the Cenozoic and thus the proxy data are reliable indicators for this 19 time period, albeit with a standard error of 2K. This uncertainty has not normally been assessed and 20 needs to be combined with other sources of uncertainty when, for instance, estimating climate 21 sensitivity based on using $\delta$ 18 O measurements from benthic foraminifera. The correlation between 22 deep and global mean surface temperature becomes weaker for pre-Cenozoic time periods (when 23 the paleogeography is significantly different than the present-day). The reasons for the weaker 24 correlation includes variability in the source region of the deep water (varying hemispheres but also 25 varying latitudes of sinking), the depth of ocean overturning (some extreme warm climates have 26 relatively shallow and sluggish circulations weakening the link between surface and deep ocean), 27 and the extent of polar amplification (e.g. ice albedo feedbacks). Deep ocean sediments prior to the 28 Cretaceous are rare, so extending the benthic foram proxy further into deeper time is problematic, 29 but the model results presented here would suggest that the predicted deep ocean temperatures 30 would probably be unreliable. 31},

abstract = {Surface temperature is among the most important parameters describing planetary climate and habitability, and yet there remains considerable debate about the temperature evolution of the Earth's oceans during the Phanerozoic Eon (541 million years ago to present), the time during which complex metazoan life radiated on Earth. Here we critically assess the emerging record of Phanerozoic ocean temperatures based on carbonate clumped isotope thermometry of fossil brachiopod and mollusk shells, and we present new data that fill important gaps in the Late Paleozoic record. We evaluate and reject the hypothesis that solid-state reordering of 13C–18O bonds has destroyed the primary clumped isotope temperature signal of most fossils during sedimentary burial at elevated temperatures. The resulting Phanerozoic record, which shows a general coupling between tropical seawater temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels since the Paleozoic, indicates that tropical temperatures during the icehouse climate of the Carboniferous period were broadly similar to present (∼25–30 °C), and suggests that benthic metazoans were able to thrive at temperatures of 35–40 °C during intervals of the early and possibly the latest Paleozoic when CO2 levels were likely 5–10× higher than present-day values. Equally important, there is no resolvable trend in seawater oxygen isotope ratios ($\delta$18O) over the past ∼500 million years, indicating that the average temperature of oxygen exchange between seawater and the oceanic crust has been high (∼270 °C) since at least the early Paleozoic, which points to mid-ocean ridges as the dominant locus of water–rock interaction over the past half-billion years.},

abstract = {The latitudinal biodiversity gradient (LBG), in which species richness decreases from tropical to polar regions, is a pervasive pattern of the modern biosphere. Although the distribution of fossil occurrences suggests this pattern has varied through deep time, the recognition of palaeobiogeographic patterns is hampered by geological and anthropogenic biases. In particular, spatial sampling heterogeneity has the capacity to impact upon the reconstruction of deep time LBGs. Here we use a simulation framework to test the detectability of three different types of LBG (flat, unimodal and bimodal) over the last 300 Myr. We show that heterogeneity in spatial sampling significantly impacts upon the detectability of genuine LBGs, with known biodiversity patterns regularly obscured after applying the spatial sampling window of fossil collections. Sampling-standardization aids the reconstruction of relative biodiversity gradients, but cannot account for artefactual absences introduced by geological and anthropogenic biases. Therefore, we argue that some previous studies might have failed to recover the 'true' LBG type owing to incomplete and heterogeneous sampling, particularly between 200 and 20 Ma. Furthermore, these issues also have the potential to bias global estimates of past biodiversity, as well as inhibit the recognition of extinction and radiation events.},

abstract = {Understanding the role of sediment-water interactions in the oceanic cycling of neodymium (Nd) isotopes is essential for its reliable use as a modern and palaeoceanographic tracer of ocean circulation. However, the exact processes that control Nd cycling in the ocean are poorly defined and require an up-to-date knowledge of the sources, sinks and transformation of this tracer to and within the ocean (e.g. as per the GEOTRACES core mission). We propose a considerable improvement of Nd-source identification by providing an extensive and up-to-date compilation of published terrestrial and marine sedimentary Nd isotopic measurements. From this database, we construct high resolution, gridded, global maps that characterise the Nd-isotopic signature of the continental margins and seafloor sediment. Here, we present the database, interpolation methods, and final data products. Consistent with the previous studies that inform our compilation, our global results show unradiogenic detrital Nd isotopic values ($\epsilon$Nd ≈ -20) in the North Atlantic, $\epsilon$Nd values of ≈ -12 to -7 in the Indian and Southern Ocean, and radiogenic values ($\epsilon$Nd ≈ -3 to +4) in the Pacific. The new, high-resolution interpolation is useful for improving conceptual knowledge of Nd sources and sinks and enables the application of isotope-enabled ocean models to understand targeted Nd behaviour in the oceans. Such applications may include: examining the strength and distribution of a possible benthic flux required to reconcile global Nd budgets, establishing the potential use of Nd isotopes as a kinematic tracer of ocean circulation, and a general quantification of the non-conservative sedimentary processes that may contribute to marine Nd cycling.},

abstract = {Extensive black shale deposits formed in the Early Cretaceous South Atlantic, supporting the notion that this emerging ocean basin was a globally important site of organic carbon burial. The magnitude of organic carbon burial in marine basins is known to be controlled by various tectonic, oceanographic, hydrological, and climatic processes acting on different temporal and spatial scales, the nature and relative importance of which are poorly understood for the young South Atlantic. Here we present new bulk and molecular geochemical data from an Aptian-Albian sediment record recovered from the deep Cape Basin at Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 361, which we combine with general circulation model results to identify driving mechanisms of organic carbon burial. A multimillion-year decrease (i.e., Early Aptian-Albian) in organic carbon burial, reflected in a lithological succession of black shale, gray shale, and red beds, was caused by increasing bottom water oxygenation due to abating hydrographic restriction via South Atlantic-Southern Ocean gateways. These results emphasize basin evolution and ocean gateway development as a decisive primary control on enhanced organic carbon preservation in the Cape Basin at geological timescales (>1 Myr). The Early Aptian black shale sequence comprises alternations of shales with high (>6 %) and relatively low (∼3.5 %) organic carbon content of marine sources, the former being deposited during the global Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) 1a, as well as during repetitive intervals before and after OAE 1a. In all cases, these short-term intervals of enhanced organic carbon burial coincided with strong influxes of sediments derived from the proximal African continent, indicating closely coupled climate-land-ocean interactions. Supported by our model results, we show that fluctuations in weathering-derived nutrient input from the southern African continent, linked to changes in orbitally driven humidity and aridity, were the underlying drivers of repetitive episodes of enhanced organic carbon burial in the deep Cape Basin. These results suggest that deep marine environments of emerging ocean basins responded sensitively and directly to short-term fluctuations in riverine nutrient fluxes.We explain this relationship using the lack of wide and mature continental shelf seas that could have acted as a barrier or filter for nutrient transfer from the continent into the deep ocean.},

abstract = {This paper is a synthesis of the use of selected trace elements as proxies for reconstruction of paleoproductivity and paleoredox conditions. Many of the trace elements considered here show variations in oxidation state and solubility as a function of the redox status of the depositional environment. Redox-sensitive trace metals tend to be more soluble under oxidizing conditions and less soluble under reducing conditions, resulting in authigenic enrichments in oxygen-depleted sedimentary facies. This behavior makes U, V and Mo, and to a lesser extent certain other trace metals such as Cr and Co, useful as paleoredox proxies. Some redox-sensitive elements are delivered to the sediment mainly in association with organic matter (Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd) and they may be retained within the sediment in association with pyrite, after organic matter decay in reducing sediment. This particularity confers to Ni and Cu a good value as proxies for organic C sinking flux (frequently referred to as productivity). Elements with only one oxidation state such as Ba and P are classically used to assess paleoproductivity levels but they suffer from the fact that they are solubilized under reducing conditions and may be lost from oxygen-deprived sediments. The combined used of U, V and Mo enrichments may allow suboxic environments to be distinguished from anoxic-euxinic ones. Specifically, these elements tend to be much more strongly enriched in anoxic-euxinic environments and to exhibit weaker covariation with TOC than in suboxic environments. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Arsenic (As) is reputed to be a redox-sensitive element but has not been fully explored yet as a proxy in marine sediments and sedimentary rocks, compared to extensively examined elements such as molybdenum (Mo) and uranium (U). Here the behavior of As is compared to that of Mo and U in a number of paleo-environmental situations that have been studied before and are, therefore, rather well constrained. The results indicate that attention must be paid to the reference values used to normalize sedimentary As content in geochemical studies. The most-commonly used references (namely the Post-Archean Australian Shale and average upper crust of Earth, to be opposed to the Average Shale) tend to overestimate slightly As enrichments as shown by As enrichment factors being quasi systematically larger than 1, whatever the geological setting. The results also show that As enrichments are less straightforward compared to those of Mo and U, when using these elements as redox proxies. In addition, the depositional milieus that endured the most hydrologically-restricted and/or reducing (euxinic) conditions are not those with the highest As enrichments. Thus, arsenic shows a redox-sensitive behavior but is not adequate as a redox proxy. However As enrichments are correlated with Mo enrichments in two distinct types of situations: settings impacted 1) by particulate iron shuttling processes and, 2) by diagenetic fluid circulation (cold seeps). In both cases, the Mo-As correlation is induced by the strong relationship between these trace metals and reactive iron: Fe conveys both As and Mo to the sediment where they are trapped. Thus arsenic has a promising potential to allow recognition of past depositional environments associated with iron shuttling and (cold) seep circulations. Lastly, high-TOC, high-Mo, low-As situations point out possible occurrences of sulfurized organic matter in sediments. High Mo concentrations indicate reducing, sulfidic conditions prone to organic-matter accumulation (high TOC values), but low As concentrations indicate that reactive iron was a limiting factor, preventing As capture. Under such conditions, free H2S was not associating with iron and could react with organic matter, causing its sulfurization.},

abstract = {Organic acids secreted by plants and microorganisms are ubiquitous in modern soils. These acids possess a particularly strong binding affinity for aluminum, accelerating its release from mineral surfaces and driving its preferential loss relative to immobile elements such as titanium. Aluminum-titanium (Al-Ti) decoupling in ancient soils may therefore serve as a tracer of a biotic influence on terrestrial weathering in Earth's past. To explore this idea, we used a mass balance approach to quantify Al mobility in 33 definitive and chronologically well-constrained paleosols spanning the Archean to Miocene. We estimated expected Al release for a given weathering intensity under abiotic conditions using previously established experimental relationships between the relative losses of Al and magnesium (Mg), a mobile element with a much lower organic acid binding affinity. We report Al release likely attributable to organic acid weathering in all paleosols, with net loss in 13, net gain in 16, and a balance between loss and gain in four. This provides a new line of support for a significant terrestrial biosphere as far back as the mid-Archean. Interestingly, there is no statistically significant change in Al mobility across major transitions such as the Great Oxidation Event or the Paleozoic spread of vascular plants. This controversially suggests that localized organic acid weathering, at least within the surface environments captured by the paleosol record, may have been as common on early Earth as it is today.},

abstract = {Records of carbon dioxide concentrations (partial pressure expressed as pCO2) over Earth's history provide trends that are critical to understand our changing world. To better constrain pCO2 estimations, here we test organic pCO2 proxies against the direct measurements of pCO2 recorded in ice cores. Based on the concept of stable carbon isotopic fractionation due to photosynthetic CO2 fixation (Ɛp), we use the stable carbon isotopic composition ($\delta$13C) of the recently proposed biomarker phytol (from all photoautotrophs), as well as the conventionally used alkenone biomarkers (from specific species) for comparison, to reconstruct pCO2 over several Quaternary sapropel formation periods (S1, S3, S4, and S5) in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The reconstructed pCO2 values are within error of the ice core values but consistently exceed the ice core values by ca. 100 µatm. This offset corresponds with atmospheric disequilibrium of present day CO2[aq] concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea from global pCO2, equivalent to ca. 100 µatm, although pCO2 estimates derived from individual horizons within each sapropel do not covary with the ice core values. This may possibly be due to greater variability in local CO2[aq] concentration changes in the Mediterranean, as compared with the global average pCO2, or possibly due to biases in the proxy, such as variable growth rate or carbon-concentrating mechanisms. Thus, the offset is likely a combination of physiological or environmental factors. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that alkenone- and phytol-based pCO2 proxies yield statistically similar estimations (P-value = 0.02, Pearson's r-value = 0.56), and yield reasonable absolute estimations although with relatively large uncertainties (±100 µatm).},

These contradictory findings are hard to reconcile theoretically.We analyze marine invertebrate biodiversity patterns for the Phanerozoic Eon while controlling for sampling effort. This control appears to reverse the temporal association between temperature and biodiversity, such that taxonomic richness increases, not decreases, with temperature. Increasing temperatures also predict extinction and origination rates, alongside other abiotic and biotic predictor variables. These results undermine previous reports of a negative biodiversity-temperature relationship through time, which we attribute to paleontological sampling biases.

Interrelationships among variables suggest long-term interactions among continental flooding, sulfur and carbon cycling, and macroevolution. Thus, mutual responses to interacting Earth systems, not sampling biases, explain much of the observed covariation between Phanerozoic patterns of sedimentation and fossil biodiversity.

However, the precise timing and extent to which oceanic anoxic conditions expanded during OAE 2 remains unresolved. We present a record of global ocean redox changes during OAE 2 using a combined geochemical and carbon cycle modeling approach. We utilize a continuous, high-resolution record of uranium isotopes in pelagic and platform carbonate sediments to quantify the global extent of seafloor anoxia during OAE 2. This dataset is then compared with a dynamic model of the coupled global carbon, phosphorus, and uranium cycles to test hypotheses for OAE 2 initiation. This unique approach highlights an intra-OAE complexity that has previously been underconstrained, characterized by two expansions of anoxia separated by an episode of globally significant reoxygenation coincident with the "Plenus Cold Event."

abstract = {Oceanic anoxia has been proposed as a proximate cause of the end- Permian mass extinction (EPME), but evaluation of this hypothesis is hampered by limited detailed knowledge of its timing and extent. The recent development of uranium isotopes ($\delta$238U) in carbonates as a global-ocean redox proxy provides new insights into this problem. Three earlier $\delta$238U studies of Tethyan sections inferred development of extensive oceanic anoxia at the EPME. However, recent work raises concerns that diagenetic alteration may influence the reliability of $\delta$238U records in bulk carbonate sediments. Here, we evaluate this possibility through $\delta$238U analysis of a Permian-Triassic carbonate atoll section from the Panthalassic Ocean (Kamura, Japan) and comparison with existing $\delta$238U profiles from the Tethys Ocean. The Kamura section exhibits a large negative $\delta$238U shift across the EPME horizon identical both in timing and magnitude to those in Tethyan sections, demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the negative seawater $\delta$238U shift at the EPME was a global event, and that it was recorded by shallow carbonate facies globally. The robustness of the U-isotope proxy is further shown by the fact that a common global signal at the EPME was preserved despite major differences in the burial histories of Panthalassic and Tethyan sections, the former having been tectonically subducted and heated to greenschist metamorphic grade, whereas the latter accumulated in stable cratonic settings and experienced milder burial effects. Finally, we use leaching experiments to demonstrate that, although small-scale $\delta$238U heterogeneity is common in both modern and ancient carbonates, it probably does not significantly affect bulk-carbonate $\delta$238U trends.},

abstract = {Explaining the ∼5-million-year delay in marine biotic recovery following the latest Permian mass extinction, the largest biotic crisis of the Phanerozoic, is a fundamental challenge for both geological and biological sciences. Ocean redox perturbations may have played a critical role in this delayed recovery. However, the lack of quantitative constraints on the details of Early Triassic oceanic anoxia (for example, time, duration, and extent) leaves the links between oceanic conditions and the delayed biotic recovery ambiguous. We report high-resolution U-isotope ($\delta$238U) data from carbonates of the uppermost Permian to lowermost Middle Triassic Zal section (Iran) to characterize the timing and global extent of ocean redox variation during the Early Triassic. Our $\delta$238U record reveals multiple negative shifts during the Early Triassic. Isotope mass-balance modeling suggests that the global area of anoxic seafloor expanded substantially in the Early Triassic, peaking during the latest Permian to mid-Griesbachian, the late Griesbachian to mid-Dienerian, the Smithian-Spathian transition, and the Early/Middle Triassic transition. Comparisons of the U-, C-, and Sr-isotope records with a modeled seawater PO43- concentration curve for the Early Triassic suggest that elevated marine productivity and enhanced oceanic stratification were likely the immediate causes of expanded oceanic anoxia. The patterns of redox variation documented by the U-isotope record show a good first-order correspondence to peaks in ammonoid extinctions during the Early Triassic. Our results indicate that multiple oscillations in oceanic anoxia modulated the recovery of marine ecosystems following the latest Permian mass extinction.},

abstract = {The role of O2 in the evolution of early animals, as represented by some members of the Ediacara biota, has been heavily debated because current geochemical evidence paints a conflicting picture regarding global marine O2 levels during key intervals of the rise and fall of the Ediacara biota. Fossil evidence indicates that the diversification the Ediacara biota occurred during or shortly after the Ediacaran Shuram negative C-isotope Excursion (SE), which is often interpreted to reflect ocean oxygenation. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding ocean oxygen levels during the SE and the middle Ediacaran Period. To help resolve this debate, we examined U isotope variations ($\delta$238U) in three carbonate sections from South China, Siberia, and USA that record the SE. The $\delta$238U data from all three sections are in excellent agreement and reveal the largest positive shift in $\delta$238U ever reported in the geologic record (from $\sim$ −0.74‰ to $\sim$ −0.26‰). Quantitative modeling of these data suggests that the global ocean switched from a largely anoxic state (26%–100% of the seafloor overlain by anoxic waters) to near-modern levels of ocean oxygenation during the SE. This episode of ocean oxygenation is broadly coincident with the rise of the Ediacara biota. Following this initial radiation, the Ediacara biota persisted until the terminal Ediacaran period, when recently published U isotope data indicate a return to more widespread ocean anoxia. Taken together, it appears that global marine redox changes drove the rise and fall of the Ediacara biota.},

abstract = {Evolution of terrestrial plants, the first vascular plants, the first trees, and then whole forest ecosystems had far reaching consequences for Earth system dynamics. These innovations are considered important moments in the evolution of the atmosphere, biosphere, and oceans, even if the effects might have lagged by hundreds of thousands or millions of years. These fundamental changes in the Earth's history happened in the Paleozoic: from the Ordovician, the time of the first land plants, to the Carboniferous, dominated by forest ecosystems. The Devonian Plant Hypothesis (DPH) was the first concept to offer a full and logical explanation of the many environmental changes associated with the evolution of trees/forests that took place during this time period. The DPH highlighted the impact of deep-rooted vascular plants, particularly trees on weathering processes, pedogenesis, nutrient transport, CO2 cycling, organic and inorganic carbon deposition, and suggests further possible consequences on the marine realm (oceanic anoxia and extinction during the Late Devonian). Here we attempt to combine the DPH and the related expansion in biodiversity, the Devonian Plant Explosion (DePE), with the Biogeomorphic Ecosystem Engineering (BEE) concept. This idea connects tree growth and activity with initiation and/or alteration of geomorphic processes, and therefore the creation or deterioration of geomorphic landforms. We focus on trees and forest ecosystems, as the assumed dominant driver of plant-initiated change. We find that whereas there is a broad evidence of trees as important biogeomorphic ecosystem engineers, addressing the DPH is difficult due to limited, difficult to interpret, or controversial data. However, we argue the concept of BEE does shed new light on DPH and suggest new data sources that should be able to answer our main question: were Devonian trees Biogeomorphic Ecosystem engineers?},

The palaeomagnetic results are the most reliable for establishing the changing palaeolatitudes of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia. However, global palaeomagnetic reliability dwindles over the 100 Ma, and more evidence for relative continental positioning can be gleaned from study of the distribution of the faunas in the later parts of the interval. The new maps were generated initially from palaeomagnetic data when available, but sometimes modified, and terranes were positioned in longitude to take account of key faunal data derived from the occurrences of selected trilobites, brachiopods and fish. Kinematic continuity over the long period is maintained. The many terranes without reliable palaeomagnetic data are placed according to the affinities of their contained fauna. The changing positions of the vast palaeocontinent of Gondwana (which has hitherto been poorly constrained) as it drifted over the South Pole during the interval have been revised and are now more confidently shown following analysis of both faunal and palaeomagnetic data in combination, as well as by the glacial and periglacial sediments in the latest Ordovician. In contrast, the peri-Gondwanan and other terranes of the Middle and Far East, Central Asia and Central America are poorly constrained.},

Planktic foraminiferal I/Ca is a promising tool to reconstruct the extent of past upper ocean oxygenation, but a thorough assessment is necessary to evaluate both its potential and its limitations. We used foraminifers from Holocene core-tops (Southeast Atlantic Ocean) to document planktic I/Ca across a range of oceanographic conditions. Subsurface O2 concentrations may be the dominant control on planktic foraminiferal I/Ca and planktic I/Ca decreases rapidly at low O2 conditions (O2 < ∼70–100 µmol/kg). We thus document that low planktic I/Ca can be used empirically to indicate hypoxia in the upper water column, but questions remain as to the mechanistic understanding of the relation between seawater iodine speciation change, its O2 threshold and foraminiferal I/Ca. Planktic I/Ca records from core GeoB1720-2 (Benguela Upwelling System, SE Atlantic) suggest that hypoxic waters were present near the site persistently during the last 240 ka, without clear glacial-interglacial variability.},

It was typified by a rapid rise in atmospheric CO2, global warming, and marine anoxia, leading to the widespread devastation of marine ecosystems. However, the precise timing and extent to which oceanic anoxic conditions expanded during OAE 2 remains unresolved. We present a record of global ocean redox changes during OAE 2 using a combined geochemical and carbon cycle modeling approach. We utilize a continuous, high-resolution record of uranium isotopes in pelagic and platform carbonate sediments to quantify the global extent of seafloor anoxia during OAE 2. This dataset is then compared with a dynamic model of the coupled global carbon, phosphorus, and uranium cycles to test hypotheses for OAE 2 initiation. This unique approach highlights an intra-OAE complexity that has previously been underconstrained, characterized by two expansions of anoxia separated by an episode of globally significant reoxygenation coincident with the "Plenus Cold Event." Each anoxic expansion event was likely driven by rapid atmospheric CO2 injections from multiphase Large Igneous Province activity.},

abstract = {Understanding of the role of ocean circulation on climate during the Late Cretaceous is contingent on the ability to reconstruct its modes and evolution. Geochemical proxies used to infer modes of past circulation provide conflicting interpretations for the reorganization of the ocean circulation through the Late Cretaceous. Here, we present climate model simulations of the Cenomanian (100.5-93.9&thinsp;Ma) and Maastrichtian (72.1-66.1&thinsp;Ma) stages of the Cretaceous with the CCSM4 earth system model. We focus on intermediate (500-1500&thinsp;m) and deep (>&thinsp;1500&thinsp;m) ocean circulation and show that while there is continuous deep-water production in the southwestern Pacific, major circulation changes occur between the Cenomanian and Maastrichtian. Opening of the Atlantic and Southern Ocean, in particular, drives a transition from a mostly zonal circulation to enhanced meridional exchange. Using additional experiments to test the effect of deepening of major ocean gateways in the Maastrichtian, we demonstrate that the geometry of these gateways likely had a considerable impact on ocean circulation. We further compare simulated circulation results with compilations of span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"iϵ/iNd/span records and show that simulated changes in Late Cretaceous ocean circulation are reasonably consistent with proxy-based inferences. In our simulations, consistency with the geologic history of major ocean gateways and absence of shift in areas of deep-water formation suggest that Late Cretaceous trends in span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"iϵ/iNd/span values in the Atlantic and southern Indian oceans were caused by the subsidence of volcanic provinces and opening of the Atlantic and Southern oceans rather than changes in deep-water formation areas and/or reversal of deep-water fluxes.

Modeling shows that this pattern is well explained by enhanced Pacific meridional overturning circulation (PMOC), which brings warm, salty, and nutrient-poor subtropical waters to high latitudes.

However, it remains unclear whether internal feedbacks are large enough to account for the radically different glacial and interglacial states. Here we provide support for an alternative view: Glacial-interglacial states are multiple equilibria of the climate system that exist for the same external forcing. We show that such multiple equilibria resembling glacial and interglacial states can be found in a complex coupled general circulation model of the ocean-atmosphere-sea ice system. The multiple states are sustained by ice-albedo feedback modified by ocean heat transport and are not caused by the bistability of the ocean's overturning circulation. In addition, expansion/contraction of the Southern Hemisphere ice pack over regions of upwelling, regulating outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere, is the primary mechanism behind a large pCO2 change between states.},

abstract = {The glacial cycles of the Pleistocene involve changes in the circulation of the deep ocean in important ways. This review seeks to establish what were the robust patterns of deep-sea water mass changes and how they might have influenced important parts of the last glacial cycle. After a brief review of how tracers in the modern ocean can be used to understand the distribution of water masses, I examine the data for biogeochemical, circulation rate, and conservative tracers during glacial climates. Some of the robust results from the literature of the last 30 years include: a shoaled version of northern source deep water in the Atlantic, expanded southern source water in the abyss and deep ocean, salt (rather than heat) stratification of the last glacial maximum (LGM) deep-sea, and several lines of evidence for slower overturning circulation in the southern deep cell. We combine these observations into a new idea for how the ocean-atmosphere system moves from interglacial to glacial periods across a single cycle. By virtue of its influence on the melting of land-based ice around Antarctica, cooling North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) leads to a cold and salty version of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). This previously underappreciated feedback can lead to a more stratified deep ocean that operates as a more effective carbon trap than the modern, helping to lower atmospheric CO2 and providing a mechanism for the deep ocean to synchronize the hemispheres in a positive feedback that drives the system to further cooling.

It combines paleotemperature measurements determined from oxygen isotopes with broader insights obtained from the changing distribution of lithologic indicators of climate, such as coals, evaporites, calcretes, reefs, and bauxite deposits. The waxing and waning of the Earth's great polar icecaps have been mapped using the past distribution of tillites, dropstones, and glendonites. The global temperature model presented here includes estimates of average global temperate (GAT), changing tropical temperatures (∆T° tropical), deep ocean temperatures, and polar temperatures. Though similar, in many respects, to the temperature history deduced directly from the study of oxygen isotopes, our model does not predict the extreme high temperatures for the Early Paleozoic required by isotopic investigations. The history of global changes in temperature during the Phanerozoic has been summarized in a “paleotemperature timescale” that subdivides the many past climatic events into 8 major climate modes; each climate mode is made up of 3-4 pairs of warming and cooling episodes (chronotemps). A detailed narrative describes how these past temperature events have been affected by geological processes such as the eruption of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPS) (warming) and bolide impacts (cooling). The paleotemperature model presented here allows for a deeper understanding of the interconnected geologic, tectonic, paleoclimatic, paleoceanographic, and evolutionary events that have shaped our planet, and we make explicit predictions about the Earth's past temperature that can be tested and evaluated. By quantitatively describing the pattern of paleotemperature change through time, we may be able to gain important insights into the history of the Earth System and the fundamental causes of climate change on geological timescales. These insights can help us better understand the problems and challenges that we face as a result of Future Global Warming.},

abstract = {Past greenhouse intervals of the Mesozoic were repeatedly punctuated by Ocean Anoxic Events (OAEs), major perturbations to the global carbon cycle and abrupt climate changes that may serve as relevant analogs for Earth's greenhouse gas-forced climate future. The key to better understanding these transient climate disruptions and possible CO2-forced tipping-points resides in high-resolution, precise, and accurate estimates of atmospheric CO2 for individual OAEs. Here we present a high-temporal resolution, multi-proxy pCO2 reconstruction for the onset of mid-Cretaceous (Albian–Cenomanian Boundary) OAE1d. Coupling of pCO2 estimates with carbon isotopic compositions ($\delta$13C) of charcoal, vitrain, and cuticle from the Rose Creek Pit (RCP), Nebraska, reveals complex phasing, including a lag between the well-documented negative $\delta$13C excursion defining the onset of OAE1d and the CO2 increase. This lag indicates that increased CO2 or other C-based greenhouse gases may not have been the primary cause of the negative excursion. Our study reveals a pCO2 increase within the interval of the negative $\delta$13C excursion, reaching a maximum of up to ∼840 ppm (95% confidence interval −307 ppm/+167 ppm) toward its end. The reconstructed magnitude of CO2 increase (∼357 ppm) is similar to that of Late Cretaceous OAE2 but of smaller magnitude than that of other major carbon cycle perturbations of the Mesozoic assessed via stomatal methods (e.g., the Toarcian OAE [TOAE], Triassic–Jurassic boundary event, Cretaceous–Paleogene Boundary event). Furthermore, our results indicate a possible shared causal or developmental mechanism with OAE1a and the TOAE.},

abstract = {The high concentration of molecular oxygen in Earth's atmosphere is arguably the most conspicuous and geologically important signature of life. Earth's early atmosphere lacked oxygen; accumulation began after the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria around 3.0-2.5 billion years ago (Gya). Concentrations of oxygen have since varied, first reaching near-modern values *600 million years ago (Mya). These fluctuations have been hypothesized to constrain many biological patterns, among them the evolution of body size. Here, we review the state of knowledge relating oxygen availability to body size. Laboratory studies increasingly illuminate the mechanisms by which organisms can adapt physiologically to the variation in oxygen availability, but the extent to which these findings can be extrapolated to evolutionary timescales remains poorly understood. Experiments confirm that animal size is limited by experimental hypoxia, but show that plant vegetative growth is enhanced due to reduced photorespiration at lower O 2:CO 2. Field studies of size distributions across extant higher taxa and individual species in the modern provide qualitative support for a correlation between animal and protist size and oxygen availability, but few allow prediction of maximum or mean size from oxygen concentrations in unstudied regions. There is qualitative support for a link between oxygen availability and body size from the fossil record of protists and animals, but there have been few quantitative analyses confirming or refuting this impression. As oxygen transport limits the thickness or volume-to-surface area ratio-rather than mass or volume-predictions of maximum possible size cannot be constructed simply from metabolic rate and oxygen availability. Thus, it remains difficult to confirm that the largest representatives of fossil or living taxa are limited by oxygen transport rather than other factors. Despite the challenges of integrating findings from experiments on model organisms, comparative observations across living species, and fossil specimens spanning millions to billions of years, numerous tractable avenues of research could greatly improve quantitative constraints on the role of oxygen in the macroevolutionary history of organismal size. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

abstract = {Sharp increases in atmospheric CO2 are resulting in ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation that threatenmarine organisms on continentalmargins and their ecological functions and resulting ecosystem services. The relative influence of these stressors on biodiversity remains unclear, as well as the threshold levels for change and when secondary stressors become important. One strategy to interpret adaptation potential and predict future faunal change is to examine ecological shifts along natural gradients in the modern ocean. Here, we assess the explanatory power of temperature, oxygen and the carbonate system for macrofaunal diversity and evenness along continental upwelling margins using variance partitioning techniques. Oxygen levels have the strongest explanatory capacity for variation in species diversity. Sharp drops in diversity are seen as O2 levels decline through the 0.5-0.15 ml l-1 (approx. 22-6 $\mu$M; approx. 21-5 matm) range, and as temperature increases through the 7-10°C range. pCO2 is the best explanatory variable in the Arabian Sea, but explains little of the variance in diversity in the eastern Pacific Ocean. By contrast, very little variation in evenness is explained by these three global change variables. The identification of sharp thresholds in ecological response are used here to predict areas of the seafloor where diversity is most at risk to future marine global change, noting that the existence of clear regional differences cautions against applying global thresholds.},

abstract = {The effect of changes in zonal and meridional atmospheric moisture transports on Atlantic overturning is investigated. Zonal transports are considered in terms of net moisture export from the Atlantic sector. Meridional transports are related to the vigour of the global hydrological cycle. The equilibrium thermohaline circulation (THC) simulated with an efficient climate model is strongly dependent on two key parameters that control these transports: an anomaly in the specified Atlantic-Pacific moisture flux ($\Delta$Fa) and atmospheric moisture diffusivity (Kq). In a large ensemble of spinup experiments, the values of $\Delta$Fa and Kq are varied by small increments across wide ranges, to identify sharp transitions of equilibrium THC strength in a 2-parameter space (between Conveyor "On" and "Off" states). Final states from this ensemble of simulations are then used as the initial states for further such ensembles. Large differences in THC strength between ensembles, for identical combinations of $\Delta$Fa and Kq, reveal the co-existence of two stable THC states (Conveyor "On" and "Off") - i.e. a bistable regime. In further sensitivity experiments, the model is forced with small, temporary freshwater perturbations to the mid-latitude North Atlantic, to establish the minimum perturbation necessary for irreversible THC collapse in this bistable regime. A threshold is identified in terms of the forcing duration required. The model THC, in a "Conveyor On" state, irreversibly collapses to a "Conveyor Off" state under additional freshwater forcing of just 0.1 Sv applied for around 100 years. The irreversible collapse is primarily due to a positive feedback associated with suppressed convection and reduced surface heat loss in the sinking region. Increased atmosphere-to-ocean freshwater flux, under a collapsed Conveyor, plays a secondary role. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {It is often argued that the $\delta$18O value of oceanic water was maintained close to 0‰ for hundreds of millions of years, as a consequence of oxygen isotope exchange between oceanic crust and seawater. However, for several decades, the interpretation of the biosedimentary oxygen isotope record has conflicted with the igneous record because, with increasing age, a general trend of decreasing $\delta$18O values (about 6‰) is observed in most carbonates, cherts and phosphates, especially for the Paleozoic and early Mesozoic. We developed a dynamical model of seawater-crust interaction that computes the $\delta$18O value in these two reservoirs as function of time. This model takes into account the continuous production of crust at oceanic ridges, its expansion rate, the permeability profile with space and time, the mineralogical mode of the crust, and the kinetics of oxygen isotope exchange between rock-forming minerals and seawater. The model indicates that the $\delta$18O value of seawater may vary by ±2‰ with a time response ranging from 5 to 50 Ma for expansion rates of 1 to 10 cm.a-1. The variation of ±2‰ is fixed by both integrated water-rock ratio and closure time of the seawater-crust system by sediments. Variations in the oxygen isotope ratio of seawater through time have important implications for the interpretation of the systematically low $\delta$18O values of pre-Jurassic marine sediments. According to our model, marine paleotemperatures could be up to 10°C lower than those expected when applying the classical hypothesis of an ice-free ocean with a $\delta$18O value of -1‰.},

Understanding complex interactions between topography and the IAM through time has been hampered, in part, by poorly resolved topography and atmospheric dynamics in climate models. Here, we employ high-resolution (0.23° × 0.31°) global climate simulations, to more accurately capture these interactions. We find that the Himalayas and Tibet primarily redirect the onshore moisture transport and produce local orographic precipitation. The Iranian Plateau is the primary gatekeeper, insulating the pool of high-enthalpy air in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) from westerly low-enthalpy advection. But, even when such high-enthalpy air exists along the IGP, vigorous precipitation in the region (poleward of 25°N) still requires orographic steering and lifting. The large-scale circulations—largely governed by sea surface temperature gradients—robustly advect water vapor onshore regardless of topography. Thus, neither topography nor localized enthalpy air drives onshore monsoon flow.},

Here, we focus on the Siwalik Group, which represents the deformed part of the foreland basin and consists of synorogenic Middle Miocene to Pleistocene sediments that form the youngest and frontal part of the Himalayan orogen. We make two important observations: (1) a distinct west-to-east increase in strain and strain rate correlates with plate convergence rates, and (2) belt morphology is inversely correlated with rainfall amount. According to the predictions of the critical taper model, an eastward increase in convergence rate would induce higher rates of material accretion. Thus, the Himalayan fold-and-thrust belt should widen eastward, yet we have observed the opposite. However, higher annual rainfall amounts and specifi c stream power appear to favor a narrower belt. Thus, we suggest that the morphology of the Himalayan foreland fold-and-thrust belt is controlled primarily by surface processes, in accordance with the critical taper model. {\textcopyright} 2014 Geological Society of America.},

Models of plateau growth vary in time, from pre-India-Asia collision (e.g., ≈100 Ma ago) to gradual uplift after the India-Asia collision (e.g., ≈55 Ma ago) and to more recent abrupt uplift (<7 Ma ago), and vary in space, from northward stepwise growth of topography to simultaneous surface uplift across the plateau. Here, we improve that understanding by presenting geologic and geophysical data from north-central Tibet, including magnetostratigraphy, sedimentology, paleocurrent measurements, and 40Ar/39Ar and fission-track studies, to show that the central plateau was elevated by 40 Ma ago. Regions south and north of the central plateau gained elevation significantly later. During Eocene time, the northern boundary of the protoplateau was in the region of the Tanggula Shan. Elevation gain started in pre-Eocene time in the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes and expanded throughout the Neogene toward its present southern and northern margins in the Himalaya and Qilian Shan. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We relate these events to the relative northward drift of India over its own slab. Our mantle- flow model derived from seismic tomography shows that dynamic topography over the southward-folded Indian slab explains the modern location of the foreland depocenter. Back in time, our model suggests that the stretched Indian slab detached from the Indian plate during the indentation of the Eurasian plate, and remained stationary underneath the northward-drifting Indian continent. We model the associated southward migration of the dynamic deflection of the topography and show that subsidence has amounted to $\sim$6000 m in the foreland basin since 15 Ma, while the dynamic surface uplift of the Himalaya amounted to $\sim$1000 m during the early Miocene. While competing with other processes, transient dynamic topography may thus explain, to a large extent, both the uplift history of the Himalaya and subsidence of its foreland basin, and should not be ignored.},

abstract = {Cooling ages of rock in the Himalayas imply that rapid exhumation between the Main Central thrust system and the South Tibetan detachment system occurred between 21 and 17 Ma. The generation of relief and enhanced weathering which followed this event may have resulted in a pronounced increase in the delivery of dissolved strontium, carbon, phosphorus, and other chemical weathering products to the ocean (Richter et al., 1992). The increased supply of nutrients stimulated productivity in oceanic upwelling zones and expansion of the oxygen minimum zone leading to enhanced burial and preservation of organic matter in the Monterey formation and other deposits from this interval. A downdraw of atmospheric CO2 associated with enhanced chemical weathering rates and organic matter burial may have led to global cooling and the expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet by 15 Ma. The above scenario differs from the “Monterey hypothesis” of Vincent and Berger in that CO2 downdraw is primarily via silicate weathering rather than organic carbon burial and that organic carbon burial is driven by increased delivery of nutrients to the ocean rather than by stronger upwelling. A carbon mass balance calculation which assumes that river fluxes have been increasing over the last 40 Ma predicts that absolute organic carbon burial increased over this interval while, at the same time, the fraction of carbon buried as organic matter versus carbonate decreased. This implies that the organic carbon cycle has acted as a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere over the late Cenozoic. Copyright 1994 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {ᅟ: Sedimentary archives in the Himalayan foreland basin and Indus submarine fan provide the most detailed records of how changing monsoon strength may have affected erosion and the development of tectonic structures in the western Himalaya during the Neogene. Muscovite Ar-Ar ages show that fast exhumation of the Greater Himalaya was earlier in the west (20–35 Ma) than in the central Himalaya (10–25 Ma), probably driven by progressive lithospheric slab tearing that caused both rock uplift and an intensified summer monsoon to start earlier in the western Himalaya. Rates of exhumation reduced after $\sim$ 17 Ma as uplift also slowed, apparently unrelated to climate change. However, further reduction at 6–8 Ma coincided with a time of weakening summer rains, as shown by carbon isotope data from the foreland and hematite-goethite records from ODP Site 730 on the Oman margin. Coming at a time of stronger winds, this drying was linked to global climatic cooling. Weakening of Late Miocene monsoon rains coincided with a southward migration of the ITCZ and faster erosion of the Lesser rather than Greater Himalaya. Unroofing of the Inner Lesser Himalaya, starting after 9 Ma, followed as a consequence of duplex formation enabled by focused erosion, although widespread exposure of that range was delayed until after 6 Ma. Inner Lesser Himalayan exposure, combined with unroofing of the Nanga Parbat Massif, caused a decrease in average $\epsilon$Nd values of Indus River sediment after 5 Ma, rather than large-scale drainage capture.

We have sampled hot springs along a 150 km stretch of the Himalayan front and find that they carry large fluxes of CO2 derived from metamorphic reactions. Hot spring fluids are saturated with CO2, have [DIC] from 1.3 to >100 mmol kg -1 and have $\delta$13CDIC values from -13% to +13% (PDB). Analysis of CO2 released by decrepitation of fluid inclusions from syn- and postdeformational quartz veins indicate that crustal fluids had $\delta$13C from -15% to +2%(PDB), consistent with production of CO2 from both thermal decomposition of organic matter and decarbonation at depth. Modeling of the hot spring fluid compositions indicates that they are strongly degassed. Combining our degassing calculations with estimates of the fraction of hydrothermal alkalinity in local rivers shows that the metamorphic degassing flux of CO2 in the 32,000 km 2 Narayani basin of the central Himalaya is >1.3 × 10 10 mol a-1, exceeding the calculated consumption of CO2 by chemical weathering for the Narayani River basin by a factor of four. Our study implies that the net impact of Himalayan orogenesis on the carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle is not large-scale drawdown of CO 2 because the weathering sink is substantially offset or even exceeded by the metamorphic source.

Recent attention has focused on increased silicate weathering of tectonically uplifted areas in the India-Asia collision zone as a possible cause for falling atmospheric CO2 levels in the Cenozoic era(5- 7). The chemistry of Neogene sediments from the main locus of sedimentary deposition for Himalayan detritus, the Bengal Fan, can be used to estimate the sinks of CO2 from silicate weathering and from the weathering and burial of organic carbon resulting from Himalayan uplift. Here we show that Neogene CO2 consumption from the net burial of organic carbon during Himalayan sediment deposition was 2-3 times that resulting from the weathering of Himalayan silicates. Thus the dominant effect of Neogene Himalayan erosion on the carbon cycle is an increase in the amount of organic carbon in the sedimentary reservoir, not an increase in silicate weathering fluxes.},

The efficiency of organic carbon deposition in sedimentary basins is however limited by the organic carbon load capacity of the sediments and organic carbon oxidation in continental margins. At the global scale, previous studies have suggested that about 70 per cent of riverine organic carbon is returned to the atmosphere, such as in the Amazon basin. Here we present a comprehensive organic carbon budget for the Himalayan erosional system, including source rocks, river sediments and marine sediments buried in the Bengal fan. We show that organic carbon export is controlled by sediment properties, and that oxidative loss is negligible during transport and deposition to the ocean. Our results indicate that 70 to 85 per cent of the organic carbon is recent organic matter captured during transport, which serves as a net sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The amount of organic carbon deposited in the Bengal basin represents about 10 to 20 per cent of the total terrestrial organic carbon buried in oceanic sediments. High erosion rates in the Himalayas generate high sedimentation rates and low oxygen availability in the Bay of Bengal that sustain the observed extreme organic carbon burial efficiency. Active orogenic systems generate enhanced physical erosion and the resulting organic carbon burial buffers atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, thereby exerting a negative feedback on climate over geological timescales. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

The aim of the present study is to quantify the impact of varying Tethys seaway depths on middle Miocene ocean and climate, in order to better understand its role in the MMCT. We present four sensitivity experiments with a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model. Our results indicate the presence of a warm and salty water source in the northern Indian Ocean when the eastern Tethys is deep open (4000 or 1000 m), which corresponds to the Tethyan Indian Saline Water (TISW) described on the basis of isotopic studies. This water source is absent in the experiments with shallow (250 m) and closed Tethys seaway, inducing strong changes in the latitudinal density gradient and ultimately the reinforcement of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Moreover, when the Tethys seaway is shallow or closed, there is a westward water flow in the Gibraltar Strait that strengthens the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) compared to the experiments with deep-open Tethys seaway. Our results therefore suggest that the shoaling and final closure of the eastern Tethys seaway played a major role in the oceanic circulation reorganisation during the middle Miocene. The results presented here provide new constraints on the timing of the Tethys seaway closure and particularly indicate that, prior to 14 Ma, a deep-open Tethys seaway should have allowed the formation of TISW. Moreover, whereas the final closure of this seaway likely played a major role in the reorganisation of oceanic circulation, we suggest that it was not the main driver of the global cooling and Antarctica ice-sheet expansion during the MMCT. Here we propose that the initiation of the MMCT was caused by an atmospheric <i>p</i>CO2 drawdown and that the oceanic changes due to the Tethys seaway closure amplified the response of global climate and East Antarctic Ice Sheet. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {It is widely believed that the Sahara desert is no more than ∼2-3 million years (Myr) old<sup>1</sup>, with geological evidence showing a remarkable aridification of north Africa at the onset of the Quaternary ice ages<sup>2-4</sup>. Before that time, north African aridity was mainly controlled by the African summer monsoon (ASM)<sup>5-8</sup>, which oscillated with Earth's orbital precession cycles. Afterwards, the Northern Hemisphere glaciation added an ice volume forcing on the ASM, which additionally oscillated with glacial-interglacial cycles<sup>2</sup>. These findings led to the idea that the Sahara desert came into existence when the Northern Hemisphere glaciated ∼2-3 Myr ago. The later discovery, however, of aeolian dune deposits ∼7 Myr old<sup>9</sup> suggested a much older age, although this interpretation is hotly challenged<sup>1</sup> and there is no clear mechanism for aridification around this time. Here we use climate model simulations to identify the Tortonian stage (∼7-11 Myr ago) of the Late Miocene epoch as the pivotal period for triggering north African aridity and creating the Sahara desert. Through a set of experiments with the Norwegian Earth System Model<sup>10</sup> and the Community Atmosphere Model<sup>11</sup>, we demonstrate that the African summer monsoon was drastically weakened by the Tethys Sea shrinkage during the Tortonian, allowing arid, desert conditions to expand across north Africa. Not only did the Tethys shrinkage alter the mean climate of the region, it also enhanced the sensitivity of the African monsoon to orbital forcing, which subsequently became the major driver of Sahara extent fluctuations. These important climatic changes probably caused the shifts in Asian and African flora and fauna observed during the same period<sup>4,12-14</sup>, with possible links to the emergence of early hominins in north Africa<sup>15,16</sup>.},

abstract = {As the most extensive highland in the world, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays an important role in shaping the global climate. Quantifying the effect of the TP on global climate is the first step for a full understanding of the TP's standing on planet Earth. Through coupled model sensitivity experiments, we draw a panorama of the TP's global impact in this paper. Our model results show that the absence of the TP would result in a 48C colder and 10% drier climate in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The TP has a striking remote effect on the North Atlantic. Removing the TP would enhance the westerlies in the mid- to high latitudes of the NH and weaken the easterlies over the tropical Pacific. More moisture would be relocated from the tropical Pacific to the North Atlantic, shutting down the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, which would eventually result in more than 158C colder and 20% drier climate over the North Atlantic. Our model results suggest that the presence of the TP may have contributed greatly to the hospitable modern climate in the NH, by promoting the establishment of the thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic, and therefore enhancing the northward ocean heat transport and atmosphere moisture transport across the equator.},

abstract = {<p>In the modern ocean, U reduction and incorporation into anoxic sediments imparts a large isotopic fractionation of approximately +0.6 ‰ that shifts the seawater $\delta$<sup>238</sup>U value (<sup>238</sup>U/<sup>235</sup>U, expressed as $\delta$<sup>238</sup>U per mil deviation relative to CRM-112a) relative to continental runoff. Given the long residence time of U in the modern oceans (∼400 kyr), the isotopic composition of carbonates (taken as a proxy for seawater) reflects the global balance between anoxic and other sinks. The U isotopic composition of open-marine carbonates has thus emerged as a proxy for reconstructing past changes in the redox state of the global ocean. A tenet of this approach is that the $\delta$ <sup>238</sup>U values of seawater and anoxic sediments should always be fractionated by the same amount.</p><p>In order to test this hypothesis, we have measured the U concentrations and isotopic compositions of carbonates spanning ages from 3250 Ma to present. A first-order expectation for the Archean and possibly Proterozoic is that near-quantitative U removal to extensive anoxic sediments should have shifted uranium isotopic composition of seawater and carbonates towards lower values. Instead, the measurements reveal that many Archean and Proterozoic carbonates have unfractionated $\delta$ <sup>238</sup>U values similar to those of continents and riverine runoff. These results are inconsistent with the view that the U isotopic composition of seawater simply reflects the areal extent of anoxic sediments in the past.</p><p>We consider two plausible explanations for why the U isotopic composition of Archean and Proterozoic carbonates is not fractionated from the crustal and riverine composition: 1) the residence time of U could have been much shorter in the Precambrian oceans when anoxic settings were much more extensive, and 2) the process of incorporation of U into anoxic sediments in the Precambrian imparted a smaller U isotopic fractionation than in the modern because of differences in the efficiency or mechanism of uranium removal. This study highlights the challenges inherent to applying knowledge of the modern marine U isotopic cycle to periods of Earth's history when ocean-floor anoxia was much more extended, anoxic basins were ferruginous, and atmospheric oxygen content was significantly lower than present.</p>},

abstract = {Multi-millennial transient simulations of climate changes have a range of important applications, such as for investigating key geologic events and transitions for which high-resolution palaeoenvironmental proxy data are available, or for projecting the long-term impacts of future climate evolution on the performance of geological repositories for the disposal of radioactive wastes. However, due to the high computational requirements of current fully coupled general circulation models (GCMs), long-term simulations can generally only be performed with less complex models and/or at lower spatial resolution. In this study, we present novel longterm "continuous" projections of climate evolution based on the output from GCMs, via the use of a statistical emulator. The emulator is calibrated using ensembles of GCM simulations, which have varying orbital configurations and atmospheric CO2 concentrations and enables a variety of investigations of long-term climate change to be conducted, which would not be possible with other modelling techniques on the same temporal and spatial scales. To illustrate the potential applications, we apply the emulator to the late Pliocene (by modelling surface air temperature-SAT), comparing its results with palaeo-proxy data for a number of global sites, and to the next 200 kyr (thousand years) (by modelling SAT and precipitation). A range of CO2 scenarios are prescribed for each period. During the late Pliocene, we find that emulated SAT varies on an approximately precessional timescale, with evidence of increased obliquity response at times. A comparison of atmospheric CO2 concentration for this period, estimated using the proxy sea surface temperature (SST) data from different sites and emulator results, finds that relatively similar CO2 concentrations are estimated based on sites at lower latitudes, whereas higher-latitude sites show larger discrepancies. In our second illustrative application, spanning the next 200 kyr into the future, we find that SAT oscillations appear to be primarily influenced by obliquity for the first 120 kyr, whilst eccentricity is relatively low, after which precession plays a more dominant role. Conversely, variations in precipitation over the entire period demonstrate a strong precessional signal. Overall, we find that the emulator provides a useful and powerful tool for rapidly simulating the long-term evolution of climate, both past and future, due to its relatively high spatial resolution and relatively low computational cost. However, there are uncertainties associated with the approach used, including the inability of the emula-tor to capture deviations from a quasi-stationary response to the forcing, such as transient adjustments of the deep-ocean temperature and circulation, in addition to its limited range of fixed ice sheet configurations and its requirement for prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentrations.},

abstract = {The spatial coverage and temporal resolution of the Early Paleozoic paleoclimate record are limited, primarily due to the paucity of well-preserved skeletal material commonly used for oxygen-isotope paleothermometry. Bulk-rock $\delta$ 18 O datasets can provide broader coverage and higher resolution, but are prone to burial alteration. We assess the diagenetic character of two thick Cambro–Ordovician carbonate platforms with minimal to moderate burial by pairing clumped and bulk isotope analyses of micritic carbonates. Despite resetting of the clumped-isotope thermometer at both sites, our samples indicate relatively little change to their bulk $\delta$ 18 O due to low fluid exchange. Consequently, both sequences preserve temporal trends in $\delta$ 18 O . Motivated by this result, we compile a global suite of bulk rock $\delta$ 18 O data, stacking overlapping regional records to minimize diagenetic influences on overall trends. We find good agreement of bulk rock $\delta$ 18 O with brachiopod and conodont $\delta$ 18 O trends through time. Given evidence that the $\delta$ 18 O value of seawater has not evolved substantially through the Phanerozoic, we interpret this record as primarily reflecting changes in tropical, nearshore seawater temperatures and only moderately modified by diagenesis. Focusing on the samples with the most enriched, and thus likely least-altered, $\delta$ 18 O values, we reconstruct Late Cambrian warming, Early Ordovician extreme warmth, and cooling around the Early–Middle Ordovician boundary. Our record is consistent with models linking the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event to cooling of previously very warm tropical oceans. In addition, our high-temporal-resolution record suggests previously unresolved transient warming and climate instability potentially associated with Late Ordovician tectonic events.},

However, the imbalance resulting from accelerated CO2 consumption and a relatively stable CO2 input from volcanic degassing during the Cenozoic should have depleted atmospheric CO2 within a few million years; therefore, a negative feedback mechanism must have stabilized the carbon cycle. Here, we present the first almost-complete Paleogene silicate weathering intensity (SWI) records from continental rocks in the northern Tibetan Plateau showing that silicate weathering in this tectonically inactive area was modulated by global temperature. These findings suggest that Paleogene global cooling was also strongly influenced by a temperature feedback mechanism, which regulated silicate weathering rates and hydrological cycles and maintained a nearly stable carbon cycle. It acted as a negative feedback by decreasing CO2 consumption resulting from the lower SWI and the kinetic limitations in tectonically inactive areas.},

We show that growth of north and northeastern Tibet affects vegetation and, crucially, plant diversity in eastern Asia by altering the monsoon system. This northern Tibetan orographic change induces a precipitation increase, especially in the dry (winter) season, resulting in a transition from deciduous broadleaf vegetation to evergreen broadleaf vegetation and plant diversity increases across southeastern Asia.

abstract = {<p>Paleogeographic maps are essential tools for understanding Earth system dynamics. They provide boundary conditions for climate and geodynamic modelling, for analysing surface processes and biotic interactions. However, the temporal and spatial distribution of key features such as seaways and mountain belts that govern climate changes and biotic interchange differ between various paleogeographies that require regular updates with new data and models. We developed a reproducible and systematic approach to paleogeographic reconstruction and provide a set of worldwide Cenozoic paleogeographic maps at 60, 40 and 20 Ma. We followed a six-stage methodology that integrates an extensive review of geological data into a coherent plate tectonic model using the open source software GPlates. (1) We generated a global plate kinematic model, and reconstructed intensely-deformed plate boundaries using a review of structural, paleomagnetic and other geologic data in six key regions: the Andes, the North American Cordillera, the Scotia Arc, Africa, the Mediterranean region and the Tibetan-Himalayan collision zone. (2) We modified previously published paleobathymetry in several regions where continental and oceanic crust overlap due to differences in the plate models. (3) We then defined paleoshorelines using updated fossil and geologic databases to locate the terrestrial to marine transition. (4) We applied isostatic compensation in polar regions and global eustatic sea level adjustments. (5) Paleoelevations were estimated using a broad range of data including thermochronology and stable isotopes, combined with paleobotanical (mostly pollen and leaf physiognomy), structural and geomorphological data. We address ongoing controversies on the mechanisms and chronology of India-Asia collision by providing alternate reconstructions for each time slice. We finally discuss the implications of our reconstructions on the Cenozoic evolution of continental weatherability and review methodological limitations and potential improvements. Future addition of new data, tools and reconstructions can be accommodated through a dedicated interactive website tool (<a href="https://map.paleoenvironment.eu/">https://map.paleoenvironment.eu/</a>) that enables users to interactively upload and download data and compare with other models, and generate their own plots.

abstract = {The distribution of last occurrences of fossil taxa in a stratigraphic column are used to infer the pattern, timing and tempo of extinction from the fossil record. Clusters of last occurrences are commonly interpreted as an abrupt pulse of extinction. However, stratigraphic architecture alone can produce clusters of last occurrences that can be misinterpreted as an extinction pulse. These clusters will typically occur in strata that immediately underlie facies changes and sequence-stratigraphic surfaces. It has been proposed that a basin-wide analysis of the fossil record within a sequence-stratigraphic framework can be used to distinguish between clusters of last occurrences caused solely by extinction pulses from those generated by sequence-stratigraphic architecture. A basin-wide approach makes it possible to observe lateral facies shifts in response to sea-level change, mitigating the effects of stratigraphic architecture. Using computer simulations of plausible Late Ordovician mass-extinction scenarios tuned to an inferred Late Ordovician sea-level curve, we show that stratigraphically-generated clusters of last occurrences are observed even in basin-wide analyses of the simulated fossil records due to the basin-wide loss of preferred facies for many taxa. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that by coarsening the stratigraphic resolution to the systems-tract level and identifying facies preferences of simulated taxa, we can filter out taxa whose last occurrences coincide with the basin-wide loss of their preferred facies. This enables consistent identification of the underlying extinction pattern for a wide variety of extinction scenarios. Applying this approach to empirical field data can help to constrain underlying extinction patterns from the fossil record.},

Consistent with metabolic theory, phytoplankton richness in the tropics is about three times that in higher latitudes, with temperature being the most important driver. However, below 19°C, richness is lower than expected, with $\sim$8°– 14°C waters ($\sim$35° to 60° latitude) showing the greatest divergence from theoretical predictions. Regions of reduced richness are characterized by maximal species turnover and environmental variability, suggesting that the latter reduces species richness directly, or through enhancing competitive exclusion.

abstract = {Much of the existing theory for the ocean's overturning circulation considers steady-state equilibrium solutions. However, Earth's climate is not in a steady state, and a better understanding of the ocean's nonequilibrium response to changes in the surface climate is urgently needed. Here, the time-dependent response of the deep-ocean overturning circulation to atmospheric warming is examined using a hierarchy of idealized ocean models. The transient response to surface warming is characterized by a shoaling and weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)-consistent with results from coupled climate simulations. The initial shoaling and weakening of the AMOC occurs on decadal time scales and is attributed to a rapid warming of northern-sourced deep water. The equilibrium response to warming, in contrast, is associated with a deepening and strengthening of the AMOC. The eventual deepening of the AMOC is argued to be associated with abyssal density changes and driven by modified surface fluxes in the Southern Ocean, following a reduction of the Antarctic sea ice cover. Full equilibration of the AMOC requires a diffusive adjustment of the abyss and takes many millennia. The equilibration time scale is much longer than most coupled climate model simulations, highlighting the importance of considering integration time and initial conditions when interpreting the deep-ocean circulation in climate models. The results also show that past climates are unlikely to be an adequate analog for changes in the overturning circulation during the coming decades or centuries.},

abstract = {The balance between carbon outgassing and carbon burial controls Earth's climate on geological timescales. Carbon removal in carbonates consumes both atmospheric carbon and ocean carbonate alkalinity sourced from silicate weathering on the land or seafloor. Reverse weathering (RW) refers to clay-forming reactions that consume alkalinity but not carbon. If the cations (of alkalinity) end up in clay minerals rather than in the carbonates, carbon remains as atmospheric CO2, warming the climate. Higher silicate weathering fluxes and warmer temperatures are then required to balance the carbon cycle. It has been proposed that high dissolved silica concentrations resulting from the absence of ecologically significant biogenic silica precipitation in the Precambrian drove larger RW fluxes than today, affecting the climate. Here, we present the first fully coupled carbon-silica cycle model for post-Hadean Earth history that models climate evolution self-consistently (available as open source code). RW fluxes and biogenic silica deposition fluxes are represented using a sediment diagenesis model that can reproduce modern conditions. We show that a broad range of climate evolutions are possible but most plausible scenarios produce Proterozoic warming (+5 K relative to without RW), which could help explain the sustained warmth of the Proterozoic despite lower insolation. RW in the Archean is potentially more muted due to a lower land fraction and sedimentation rate. Key model uncertainties are the modern reverse weathering flux, the rate coefficient for RW reactions, and the solubility of authigenic clays. Consequently, within the large uncertainties, other self-consistent scenarios where Proterozoic RW was unimportant cannot be excluded. Progress requires better constraints on parameters governing RW reaction rates including explicit consideration of cation-limitations to Precambrian RW, and perhaps new inferences from Si or Li isotopes systems.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic mass extinction was the most severe biotic crisis in the past 500 million years. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the crisis, but few account for the spectrum of extinction selectivity and subsequent recovery. Here we show that selective losses are best accounted for by a combination of lethally warm, shallow waters and anoxic deep waters that acted to severely restrict the habitable area to a narrow mid-water refuge zone. The relative tolerance of groups to this double whammy provides the first clear explanation for the selective extinction losses during this double-pulsed crisis and also the fitful recovery. Thus, high temperature intolerant shallow-water dwellers, such as corals, large foraminifers and radiolarians were eliminated first whilst high temperature tolerant ostracods thrived except in anoxic deeper-waters. In contrast, hypoxia tolerant but temperature intolerant small foraminifers were driven from shallow-waters but thrived on dysoxic slopes margins. Only those mollusc groups, which are tolerant of both hypoxia and high temperatures, were able to thrive in the immediate aftermath of the extinction. Limited Early Triassic benthic recovery was restricted to mid-water depths and coincided with intervals of cooling and deepening of water column anoxia that expanded the habitable mid-water refuge zone.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Climate change would cause negative impacts on future agricultural production and food security. Adaptive measures should be taken to mitigate the adverse effects. The objectives of this study were to simulate the potential effects of climate change on maize yields in Heilongjiang Province and to evaluate two selected typical household-level autonomous adaptive measures (cultivar changes and planting time adjustments) for mitigating the risks of climate change based on the CERES-Maize model. RESULTS: The results showed that flowering duration and maturity duration of maize would be shortened in the future climate and thus maize yield would reduce by 11-46% during 2011-2099 relative to 1981-2010. Increased CO2 concentration would not benefit maize production significantly. However, substituting local cultivars with later-maturing ones and delaying the planting date could increase yields as the climate changes. CONCLUSION: The results provide insight regarding the likely impacts of climate change on maize yields and the efficacy of selected adaptive measures by presenting evidence-based implications and mitigation strategies for the potential negative impacts of future climate change.},

abstract = {The recovery of marine ecosystems in the aftermath of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction was accompanied by significant carbon-cycle perturbations, as reflected in large-amplitude global excursions in Lower Triassic carbonate carbon isotope records. In the present study, we generated paired carbonate carbon ($\delta$13Ccarb), organic carbon ($\delta$13Corg), and nitrogen ($\delta$15N) isotope records along with molar C/N ratios for a composite section in the Chaohu area of Anhui Province (northern Yangtze Platform, South China) that spans the entire Lower Triassic. These records document concurrent changes among multiple proxies related to marine plankton community composition, productivity rates, and nutricline structure, providing unparalleled insights into changes at the base of the marine trophic web during the Early Triassic recovery interval.Changes in carbonate-organic carbon isotopic differences ($\Delta$13Ccarb-org) and C/N ratios indicate a general shift from anoxygenic photoautotrophy to eukaryotic algal productivity during the Early Triassic. The prevalence of prokaryotic photoautotrophs in the Griesbachian to Smithian was due to frequent environmental disturbance, whereas the reestablishment of eukaryotic algae as dominant primary producers in the Spathian reflects a general amelioration of marine environments at that time. Positive $\delta$13Ccarb excursions and brief spikes toward higher $\Delta$13Ccarb-org and C/N ratios around the Induan-Olenekian boundary and Smithian-Spathian boundary record transient shifts toward improved conditions and temporary rebounds of algal productivity. A negative $\delta$15N shift was associated with decreasing $\delta$13Ccarb, indicating that marine productivity was closely linked to N-fixation intensity owing to a general nutrient-N deficiency. Synchronous fluctuations of $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg through the Olenekian reflect changes in the $\delta$13C of oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon, but the more limited variation in $\delta$13Corg may have been due to concurrent changes in algal-microbial assemblages and, thus, net photosynthetic fractionation of carbon isotopes.},

Here we present two new neodymium isotope records from isolated carbonate platforms on both sides of the closing seaway, Malta (outcrop sampling) and the Maldives (IODP Site U1468), to constrain the evolution of past water mass exchange between the present day Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean via the Mesopotamian Seaway. Combining these data with box modeling results indicates that water mass exchange was reduced by $\sim$90% in a first step at ca. 20 Ma. The terminal closure of the seaway then coincided with the sea level drop caused by the onset of permanent glaciation of Antarctica at ca. 13.8 Ma. The termination of meridional water mass exchange through the Tethyan Seaway resulted in a global reorganization of currents, paved the way to the development of upwelling in the Arabian Sea and possibly led to a strengthening of South Asian Monsoon.},

abstract = {The devastating end-Permian mass extinction is widely considered to have been caused by large-scale and rapid greenhouse gas release by Siberian magmatism. Although the proximate extinction mechanisms are disputed, there is widespread agreement that a major extinction pulse occurred immediately below the biostratigraphically defined Permian-Triassic boundary. Our statistical analyses of stratigraphic confidence intervals do not comply with a single end-Permian extinction pulse of ammonoids in Iran. High turnover rates and extinction pulses are observed over the last 700 k.y. of the Permian period in two widely separated sections representative of a larger area. Analyses of body sizes and morphological complexity support a gradual decline over the same interval. Similar pre-mass extinction declines and disturbances of the carbon cycle have sometimes been reported from other regions, suggesting a widespread, but often overlooked, environmental deterioration at a global scale, well before the traditional main extinction pulse.},

abstract = {Paired records of $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg across the Llandovery-Wenlock boundary demonstrate asynchronous behavior during the onset of the Ireviken Biogeochemical Event (IBE). The extremely high-resolution data produced from the Altajme Core, drilled from Gotland, Sweden, capture a negative excursion in $\delta$13Corg during the initiation of the Ireviken Extinction Event (IEE) and prior to the onset of the Ireviken positive $\delta$13Ccarb Excursion (ICIE). The record of carbon isotopic changes through this interval illustrate that both $\Delta$13C (the difference between $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg) as well as the relative flux of organic carbon burial (forg) vary in unique ways and at different times during the progression of the IBE. Both process-oriented variables within the global carbon cycle ($\Delta$13C and forg) track a series of events that help to demonstrate potential causative mechanisms of both the extinction and carbon cycle perturbation. The sequence of events demonstrated here largely mirror the cascade of events that took place during the Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2) and a detailed comparison between the two events is provided here for the first time. The unique insight into the IBE presented in this work results primarily from the novel, nearly Neogene-scale resolution of the paired isotope data, which demonstrates the critical importance of high-resolution chemostratigraphic research to evaluating ancient perturbations to the Earth-life system. Additional data sets of equal or greater resolution through this interval will be critical to evaluate the global synchroneity of these short-lived events during the IBE, and similar high-resolution studies of other Paleozoic biogeochemical events may shed light on potentially similar causative mechanisms.},

abstract = {Organismic groups vary non-randomly in their vulnerability to extinction. However, it is unclear whether the same groups are consistently vulnerable, regardless of the dominant extinction drivers, or whether certain drivers have their own distinctive and predictable victims. Given the challenges presented by anthropogenic global warming, we focus on changes in extinction selectivity trends during ancient hyperthermal events: geologically rapid episodes of global warming. Focusing on the fossil record of the last 300 million years, we identify clades and traits of marine ectotherms that were more prone to extinction under the onset of six hyperthermal events than during other times. Hyperthermals enhanced the vulnerability of marine fauna that host photosymbionts, particularly zooxanthellate corals, the reef environments they provide, and genera with actively burrowing or swimming adult life-stages. The extinction risk of larger sized fauna also increased relative to non-hyperthermal times, while genera with a poorly buffered internal physiology did not become more vulnerable on average during hyperthermals. Hyperthermal-vulnerable clades include rhynchonelliform brachiopods and bony fish, whereas resistant clades include cartilaginous fish, and ostreid and venerid bivalves. These extinction responses in the geological past mirror modern responses of these groups to warming, including range-shift magnitudes, population losses, and experimental performance under climate-related stressors. Accordingly, extinction mechanisms distinctive to rapid global warming may be indicated, including sensitivity to warming-induced seawater deoxygenation. In anticipation of modern warming-driven marine extinctions, the trends illustrated in the fossil record offer an expedient preview.},

abstract = {Several studies indicate that North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation might have initiated during the globally warm Eocene (56–34 Ma). However, constraints on Eocene surface ocean conditions in source regions presently conducive to deep water formation are sparse. Here we test whether ocean conditions of the middle Eocene Labrador Sea might have allowed for deep water formation by applying (organic) geochemical and palynological techniques, on sediments from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 647. We reconstruct a long-term sea surface temperature (SST) drop from $\sim$30°C to $\sim$27°C between 41.5 to 38.5 Ma, based on TEX86. Superimposed on this trend, we record $\sim$2°C warming in SST associated with the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO; $\sim$40 Ma), which is the northernmost MECO record as yet, and another, likely regional, warming phase at $\sim$41.1 Ma, associated with low-latitude planktic foraminifera and dinoflagellate cyst incursions. Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages together with planktonic foraminiferal stable oxygen isotope ratios overall indicate low surface water salinities and strong stratification. Benthic foraminifer stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios differ from global deep ocean values by 1–2‰ and 2–4‰, respectively, indicating geographic basin isolation. Our multiproxy reconstructions depict a consistent picture of relatively warm and fresh but also highly variable surface ocean conditions in the middle Eocene Labrador Sea. These conditions were unlikely conducive to deep water formation. This implies either NADW did not yet form during the middle Eocene or it formed in a different source region and subsequently bypassed the southern Labrador Sea.},

The distribution of carbonate accumulation has varied over geological history and impacts the carbon cycle and ocean chemistry, but it remains difficult to quantitatively constrain. Here, we reconstruct Cenozoic carbonate burial along continental margins using a mass balance for global carbonate alkalinity, which integrates independent estimates for continental weathering and pelagic carbonate burial. Our results indicate that major changes in marginal carbonate burial were associated with important climate and sea-level change events, including the Eocene-Oligocene transition (ca. 34 Ma), the Oligocene-Miocene boundary Mi-1 glaciation (ca. 23 Ma), and the middle Miocene climate transition (ca. 14 Ma). In addition, we find that a major increase in continental weathering from ca. 10 Ma to the present may have driven a concomitant increase in pelagic carbonate burial. Together, our results show that changes in global climate, sea level, and continental weathering have all impacted carbonate burial over the Cenozoic, but the relative importance of these processes may have varied through time.},

Our simulations exhibit increasing equilibrium climate sensitivity with warming and suggest an Eocene sensitivity of more than 6.6°C, much greater than the present-day value (4.2°C). This higher climate sensitivity is mainly attributable to the shortwave cloud feedback, which is linked primarily to cloud microphysical processes.

abstract = {Marine ecosystem recovery after the latest Permian mass extinction (LPME) was a protracted process during the Early Triassic (∼252–247 Ma) owing to repeated climatic and environmental perturbations. Chemical weathering can supply nutrients to the ocean and may have played an important role in the Early Triassic carbon cycle and biological recovery. However, only limited geochemical records of chemical weathering during the Early Triassic have been presented to date, and the relationship between changes in weathering intensity and the slow recovery of marine ecosystems is effectively unknown. Here, we report magnesium (Mg) isotopic compositions of the siliciclastic components from shallow-marine carbonates in two well-studied Upper Permian-Lower Triassic sections in Iran and South China to track changes in chemical weathering intensity after the LPME. Both sections display a wide range of $\delta$26Mg values (−2.09‰ to +1.10‰ at Zal, −2.30‰ to +0.33‰ at Zuodeng). We identified two distinct stages (I and II) in each section based on $\delta$26Mg values and major elemental ratios. Variations of $\delta$26Mg values in Stage I (Changhsingian to mid-Dienerian) are mainly controlled by mineralogical composition that can obscure weathering signals. By contrast, $\delta$26Mg variations in Stage II (upper Dienerian to upper Spathian) are independent of lithology and inferred to reflect control by chemical weathering intensity. The trends in chemical weathering intensity within Stage II correspond to first-order variations in climate and carbon cycling. Marine ecosystem recovery during the Early Triassic may have been linked to recurrent episodes of intense chemical weathering caused by CO2 degassing and climate warming. This study demonstrates the potential utility of the Mg isotopic compositions of the silicate fraction in marine carbonates as a proxy for chemical weathering intensity, laying the groundwork for general applications of this method to deep-time Earth systems.},

abstract = {Projections of future climate depend critically on refined estimates of climate sensitivity. Recent progress in temperature proxies dramatically increases the magnitude of warming reconstructed from early Paleogene greenhouse climates and demands a close examination of the forcing and feedback mechanisms that maintained this warmth and the broad dynamic range that these paleoclimate records attest to. Here, we show that several complementary resolutions to these questions are possible in the context of model simulations using modern and early Paleogene configurations. We find that (i) changes in boundary conditions representative of slow "Earth system" feedbacks play an important role in maintaining elevated early Paleogene temperatures, (ii) radiative forcing by carbon dioxide deviates significantly from pure logarithmic behavior at concentrations relevant for simulation of the early Paleogene, and (iii) fast or "Charney" climate sensitivity in this model increases sharply as the climate warms. Thus, increased forcing and increased slow and fast sensitivity can all play a substantial role in maintaining early Paleogene warmth. This poses an equifinality problem: The same climate can be maintained by a different mix of these ingredients; however, at present, the mix cannot be constrained directly from climate proxy data. The implications of strongly state-dependent fast sensitivity reach far beyond the early Paleogene. The study of past warm climates may not narrow uncertainty in future climate projections in coming centuries because fast climate sensitivity may itself be state-dependent, but proxies and models are both consistent with significant increases in fast sensitivity with increasing temperature.},

abstract = {Polymetallic nodules found on the abyssal plains of the oceans represent one of the slowest known geological processes, and are a source of critical and rare metals for frontier technologies. A quantitative assessment of their occurrence worldwide has been hampered by a research focus on the northeastern Pacific Ocean and the lack of a global open-access data set of nodules. We have compiled a global data set of >10,000 seabed nodule and control samples, and combine it with digital grids of key environmental parameters to generate a predictive machine-learning model of nodule occurrence. In order of decreasing parameter ranking, we find that nodules are associated with very low sedimentation rates (< 0.5 cm/k.y.), moderately high oxygen values (150 and 210 mmol/m3), lithologies of clay followed by calcareous ooze, low summer surface productivity (<300 mgC/m2/day), low benthic biomass concentration (<1 log mgC/m2), water depths >4500 m, and low total organic carbon content (0.3-0.5 wt%). Competing hypotheses for nodule sustention and thus continued growth on the seafloor are the removal of sediment by bottom-water currents and biological activity. Using a high-resolution eddy-resolving ocean circulation model, we find that the bottom-current speeds over nodule fields are too low (<5 cm/s) to remove sediment, implicating the activity of epibenthic megafauna as the most likely mechanism. Our global nodule probability map combined with the assessment of a range of environmental drivers provides an improved basis for decision and policy making in the controversial area of deep-sea exploration.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between early Toarcian climatic events and the composition of kerogen assemblages in the Lusitanian Basin (Portugal). In particular, we aim to understand how the Pliensbachian–Toarcian Event (Pl–Toa Event) and Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (TOAE) affected the continental areas of the western Iberian margin and how possible variations in continental sources of organic matter (OM) were expressed in marginal-marine and hemipelagic depositional environments during the early Toarcian. We present here a characterisation [total organic carbon (TOC), total sulphur (TS), $\delta$13C in kerogen concentrate ($\delta$13CKerogen), and palynofacies] of kerogen assemblages from several uppermost Pliensbachian (emaciatum ammonite Zone)–lower Toarcian sections in the Lusitanian Basin (western Iberian margin), including the Peniche section, which contains the Toarcian GSSP. In all sections, TOC concentration is low (average 0.4 wt.%), with the highest values reaching up to 2.1 wt.% in a discrete level located approximately 10.5 m above the base of the levisoni Zone at Peniche. The TOAE negative carbon isotope excursion is observed in kerogen concentrate at the base of the levisoni Zone throughout the basin. Palynofacies analysis demonstrates that the kerogen assemblages are mostly of terrestrial affinity, with the dominance of the Phytoclast Group and terrestrial palynomorphs, and with punctual increases in amorphous organic matter, freshwater (e.g. Botryococcus sp.) and marine microplankton (dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs, and prasinophyte algae) in specific stratigraphic intervals. A change in palynofacies assemblages associated with the TOAE is observed around the base of levisoni Zone. Although with slight differences between sections, the TOAE interval records an increase in non-opaque, translucent, phytoclasts (NOP) and cuticle fragments, and is also associated with an increased contribution of terrestrial palynomorphs (increase in sporomorphs and Classopollis in tetrads and agglomerates) and decrease in marine palynomorphs. The increases in NOP and terrestrial palynomorphs support the postulated enhancement of the hydrological cycle and increased export of terrestrial OM into marine environments during the early Toarcian, especially during the TOAE, in the western Iberian margin. Understanding the impact of the early Toarcian climatic events on land-based ecosystems may provide important insights into current climate change.},

abstract = {Relatively brief periods of severe paleoenvironmental change during the Jurassic and Cretaceous were associated with the widespread accumulation of organic-rich marine deposits, termed oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). These intervals involved abrupt global warming of ∼5-10 °C, higher rates of continental weathering, elevated extinction rates, and large-scale perturbations to the global carbon cycle. The major OAEs also overlapped temporally the emplacement of large igneous provinces. However, despite being known as OAEs, the extent of seawater anoxia at those times is undefined and the causative processes remain unclear. Here we show how changes in seawater molybdenum isotope ratios (a proxy for seawater anoxia) during the Toarcian (Early Jurassic) OAE define the onset and expansion of oxygen deficient conditions. Our data also place constraints on the areal extent of marine anoxia during the event and demonstrate that anoxia expanded and contracted periodically, broadly in line with precession-driven changes in $\delta$ 13Corg. Despite their intermittent occurrence over geological history, OAEs have an important contemporary relevance because the magnitude and high rates of environmental change then were broadly similar to those occurring at the present day. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The existence of stabilizing feedbacks within Earth's climate system is generally thought to be necessary for the persistence of liquid water and life. Over the course of Earth's history, Earth's atmospheric composition appears to have adjusted to the gradual increase in solar luminosity, resulting in persistently habitable surface temperatures. With limited exceptions, the Earth system has been observed to recover rapidly from pulsed climatic perturbations. Carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation via negative feedbacks within the coupled global carbon‐silica cycles are classically viewed as the main processes giving rise to climate stability on Earth. Here we review the long‐term global carbon cycle budget, and how the processes modulating Earth's climate system have evolved over time. Specifically, we focus on the relative roles that shifts in carbon sources and sinks have played in driving long‐term changes in atmospheric pCO2. We make the case that marine processes are an important component of the canonical silicate weathering feedback, and have played a much more important role in pCO2 regulation than traditionally imagined. Notably, geochemical evidence indicate that the weathering of marine sediments and off‐axis basalt alteration act as major carbon sinks. However, this sink was potentially dampened during Earth's early history when oceans had higher levels of dissolved silicon (Si), iron (Fe), and magnesium (Mg), and instead likely fostered more extensive carbon recycling within the ocean‐atmosphere system via reverse weathering—that in turn acted to elevate ocean‐atmosphere CO2 levels.},

However, the fossil record is not truly global. It varies considerably in geographic scope and in the sampling of environments among intervals of geological time. We account for this variability using a spatially explicit approach to quantify regional-scale diversity through the Phanerozoic. Among-region variation in diversity is comparable to variation through time, and much of this is explained by environmental factors, particularly the extent of reefs. By contrast, influential hypotheses of diversity change through time, including sustained long-term increases, have little explanatory power. Modeling the spatial structure of the fossil record transforms interpretations of Phanerozoic diversity patterns and their macroevolutionary explanations. This necessitates a refocus of deep-time diversification studies.},

Magmatism from Siberian Traps is thought to have played an important role, but the causational trigger and its feedbacks are yet to be fully understood. Here we present a new boron-isotope-derived seawater pH record from fossil brachiopod shells deposited on the Tethys shelf that demonstrates a substantial decline in seawater pH coeval with the onset of the mass extinction in the latest Permian. Combined with carbon isotope data, our results are integrated in a geochemical model that resolves the carbon cycle dynamics as well as the ocean redox conditions and nitrogen isotope turnover. We find that the initial ocean acidification was intimately linked to a large pulse of carbon degassing from the Siberian sill intrusions. We unravel the consequences of the greenhouse effect on the marine environment, and show how elevated sea surface temperatures, export production and nutrient input driven by increased rates of chemical weathering gave rise to widespread deoxygenation and sporadic sulfide poisoning of the oceans in the earliest Triassic. Our findings enable us to assemble a consistent biogeochemical reconstruction of the mechanisms that resulted in the largest Phanerozoic mass extinction.},

To test their role and explore potential limits to biodiversity, we determine within-habitat (alpha), between-habitat (beta), and overall (gamma) diversity of benthic marine invertebrates for Phanerozoic geological formations. We show that an increase in gamma diversity is consistently generated by an increase in alpha diversity throughout the Phanerozoic. Beta diversity drives gamma diversity only at early stages of diversification but remains stationary once a certain gamma level is reached. This mode is prevalent during early- to mid-Paleozoic periods, whereas coupling of beta and gamma diversity becomes increasingly weak toward the recent. Generally, increases in overall biodiversity were accomplished by adding more species to local habitats, and apparently this process never reached saturation during the Phanerozoic. Our results provide general support for an ecological model in which diversification occurs in successive phases of progressing levels of biotic interactions.},

abstract = {Worldwide, a growing number of modern coastal marine ecosystems are increasingly exposed to suboxic- or even anoxic conditions. Low seawater oxygen levels trigger significant ecosystem changes and may result in mass mortality of oxygen-sensitive biota. The applicability of observations from recent (anthropogenically influenced) suboxic coastal settings to fossil anoxic shallow-marine environments is, however, as yet poorly explored. The test case documented here are upper Barremian to lower Aptian strata in the Lusitanian Basin (Ericeira section, Portugal). These are characterized by the transient demise of rudist–coral communities and the rapid establishment of microencruster facies in the vacant ecological niches. The hypothesis is tested that the temporal expansion of the microencrusting organism Lithocodium aggregatum took place in response to platform-top seawater oxygen depletion. We critically discuss the outcome of a multi-proxy palaeoseawater redox approach (e.g. Rare Earth Elements (REEs), U isotopes and palaeoecology) and put the robustness of the proxies applied here to the test. This is done by considering issues with these methods in general but also emphasizing the significance of terrigenous contamination and fractionation effects. Data shown here document that evidence for coastal seawater oxygen depletion in the prelude of Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) 1a is lacking, and hence, anoxia was not the driving mechanism for the demise of rudist–coral ecosystems in the proto-North Atlantic platform setting studied here. In contrast, well-oxygenated early Aptian platform-top water masses are proposed for this site. Geologically short (decades to millennia) fluctuations in seawater oxygen levels cannot be excluded, however. But even if these took place, they offer no explanation for the Kyr to Myr-scale patterns discussed here. The present paper is relevant as it sheds light on the complexity of mechanisms that drive punctuated Early Cretaceous coral–rudist ecosystem turnover, and assess strengths and weaknesses of redox proxies applied to ancient shallow-marine platform carbonates.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic mass extinction is the most severe biotic crisis identified in Earth history. Over 90% of marine species were eliminated, causing the destruction of the marine ecosystem structure. This biotic crisis is generally interpreted as a single extinction event around 252.3 million years ago, and has been variously attributed to the eruption of the Siberian Traps or possibly a bolide impact. Here we demonstrate that the marine extinction consisted of two pulses, separated by a 180,000-year recovery phase. We evaluated the range of 537 species representing 17 marine groups in seven Chinese sections from a 450,000-year interval spanning the Permian-Triassic boundary. The first stage of extinction occurred during the latest Permian, and was marked by the extinction of 57% of species, namely all plankton and some benthic groups, including algae, rugose corals, and fusulinids. The second phase occurred in the earliest Triassic, and resulted in the extinction of 71% of the remaining species. This second extinction phase fundamentally altered the marine ecosystem structure that had existed for the previous 200 million years. Because the two pulses showed different extinction selectivity, we conclude that they may have had different environmental causes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Modeling the long-term transient evolution of climate remains a technical and scientific challenge. However, understanding and improved modeling of the long-term behavior of the climate system increases confidence in projected changes in the mid- to long-term future. Energy balance models (EBMs) provide simplified and computationally efficient descriptions of long timescales and allow large ensemble runs by parameterizing energy fluxes. This way, they can be used to pinpoint periods and phenomena of interest. Here, we present an extended version of the two-dimensional energy balance model by Zhuang et al. (2017a). Transient CO2, solar insolation, orbital configuration, fixed ice coverage and land-sea distribution are implemented as effective radiative forcings at the land surface. We show that the model is most sensitive to changes in CO2 and ice distribution, but the obliquity and land-sea mask have significant influence on modeled temperatures as well. We tune the new model to reproduce the 1960–89 C.E. global mean temperature, equator-to-pole, and seasonal temperature gradient of the ERA20CM reanalysis (Hersbach et al., 2015). The resulting latitudinal and seasonal temperature distributions agree well with reanalysis and the general circulation model (GCM) HadCM3 for a simulation of the past millennium. We find that the EBM lacks internal climatic variability. This is attributed mostly to its reduced descriptions of heat transport and the hydrological cycle. As the model facilitates long transient simulations, we envisage its use in exploratory studies of stochastic forcing and perturbed parameterizations, thus complementing studies with comprehensive GCMs.},

abstract = {The Pliensbachian-Toarcian (Early Jurassic) fossil record is an archive of natural data of benthic community response to global warming and marine long-term hypoxia and anoxia. In the early Toarcian mean temperatures increased by the same order of magnitude as that predicted for the near future; laminated, organic-rich, black shales were deposited in many shallow water epicontinental basins; and a biotic crisis occurred in the marine realm, with the extinction of approximately 5% of families and 26% of genera. High-resolution quantitative abundance data of benthic invertebrates were collected from the Cleveland Basin (North Yorkshire, UK), and analysed with multivariate statistical methods to detect how the fauna responded to environmental changes during the early Toarcian. Twelve biofacies were identified. Their changes through time closely resemble the pattern of faunal degradation and recovery observed in modern habitats affected by anoxia. All four successional stages of community structure recorded in modern studies are recognised in the fossil data (i.e. Stage III: climax; II: transitional; I: pioneer; 0: highly disturbed). Two main faunal turnover events occurred: (i) at the onset of anoxia, with the extinction of most benthic species and the survival of a few adapted to thrive in low-oxygen conditions (Stages I to 0) and (ii) in the recovery, when newly evolved species colonized the re-oxygenated soft sediments and the path of recovery did not retrace of pattern of ecological degradation (Stages I to II). The ordination of samples coupled with sedimentological and palaeotemperature proxy data indicate that the onset of anoxia and the extinction horizon coincide with both a rise in temperature and sea level. Our study of how faunal associations co-vary with long and short term sea level and temperature changes has implications for predicting the long-term effects of "dead zones" in modern oceans. {\textcopyright} 2013 Danise et al.},

Life's influence on the Earth was hard to spot for several reasons: biologists missed it because they focused on life not Life; climatologists missed it because Life is hard to see in the Earth's energy balance; Earth system scientists opted instead for abiotic or human-centred approaches to the Earth system; Scientists in general were repelled by teleological arguments that Life acts to maintain habitable conditions. Instead, we reason from organisms' metabolisms outwards, showing how Life's coupling to its environment has led to profound effects on Earth's habitability.

Inspired by early work on biosphere–geosphere interactions and by novel perspectives such as the Gaia hypothesis, ESS emerged in the 1980s following demands for a new ‘science of the Earth'. The International Geosphere- Biosphere Programme soon followed, leading to an unprecedented level of international commitment and disciplinary integration.

abstract = {The Smithian-Spathian boundary (SSB) was an interval characterized by a major global carbon cycle perturbation, climatic cooling from a middle/late Smithian boundary hyperthermal condition, and a major setback in the recovery of marine necto-pelagic faunas from the end-Permian mass extinction. Although the SSB has been linked to changes in oceanic redox conditions, key aspects of this redox variation (e.g., duration, extent, and triggering mechanisms) and its relationship to coeval climatic and biotic changes remain unresolved. Here, we report a high-resolution middle Smithian to middle Spathian U isotope ($\delta$238U) record based on marine carbonates of the Zuodeng (South China) and Jesmond (British Columbia) sections to investigate the timing and global extent of ocean-redox variation across the SSB. Our $\delta$238U record reveals values similar to or slightly heavier than modern seawater (-0.39‰) during the middle Smithian, a rapid negative shift to highly negative values during the early late Smithian, a positive shift at the SSB, and a rapid shift back to more negative values in the early-middle Spathian. A simple U-isotope mass balance modeling suggests that the global area of anoxic seafloor expanded strongly during the late Smithian and the early-middle Spathian (covering $\sim$11% of total seafloor area), but that it contracted sharply during the SSB ($\sim$2%). The redox pattern documented by our $\delta$238U record shows a good first-order correspondence to tropical sea-surface temperature (SST) data for the Smithian-Spathian. In particular, peak anoxia coincided with the middle/late Smithian boundary hyperthermal event, and diminished anoxia with a pronounced decline in SSTs at the SSB. The temporal correlation between anoxia and low biodiversity levels of many marine clades (e.g., conodonts and ammonoids) during the late Smithian indicates that oceanic anoxia may have played a role in the SSB biocrisis.},

Here, we show that the end-Permian mass extinction coincided with a rapid temperature rise to exceptionally high values in the Early Triassic that were inimical to life in equatorial latitudes and suppressed ecosystem recovery. This was manifested in the loss of calcareous algae, the near-absence of fish in equatorial Tethys, and the dominance of small taxa of invertebrates during the thermal maxima. High temperatures drove most Early Triassic plants and animals out of equatorial terrestrial ecosystems and probably were a major cause of the end-Smithian crisis.},

abstract = {The transition from the Smithian substage to the Spathian substage of the Olenekian stage of the late Early Triassic was a critical time marked by a series of biological and environmental changes during the multimillion-year recovery interval following the end-Permian mass extinction. However, the Smithian/Spathian boundary (SSB) does not yet have an agreed definition, a shortcoming that complicates high-resolution analysis of events during the Smithian-Spathian transition. Here, we review key biostratigraphic (i.e., ammonoid and conodont) studies of the Smithian and Spathian substages in historically important regions (e.g., the Canadian Arctic for the Boreal realm, western North America for the eastern Panthalassic Ocean) and more recently re-studied locations (e.g., Pakistan and India in the southern Tethys, South China in the eastern Tethys) as well as the carbon isotope chemostratigraphy of 29 major Smithian-Spathian sections globally. Key ammonoid genera (e.g., Wasatchites, Anasibirites, Glyptophiceras and Xenoceltites of the late Smithian, and Bajarunia, Tirolites and Columbites of the early Spathian), conodont species (e.g., Scythogondolella milleri, Novispathodus waageni, and Borinella buurensis of the late Smithian, and ‘Triassospathodus' hungaricus, Neogondolella aff. sweeti, and Icriospathodus spp. of the early Spathian), and carbonate carbon isotope excursions provide appropriate markers for constraining the SSB. Use of the first occurrence of the conodont Novispathodus pingdingshanensis as a potential marker of the SSB is also discussed. Based on correlations of biostratigraphic and carbon isotope data globally, we propose to revise previous placements of the SSB transition in some sections. Finally, we show that the Smithian Thermal Maximum (STM; herein named) was middle Smithian in age and not correlative with the SSB, as inferred in some earlier studies, and that the SSB coincided with a subsequent major global cooling event.},

abstract = {Anoxic and iron-rich (ferruginous) conditions prevailed in the ocean under the low-oxygen atmosphere that occurred through most of the Archean Eon. While euxinic conditions (i.e. anoxic and hydrogen sulfide-rich waters) became more common in the Proterozoic, ferruginous conditions persisted in deep waters. Ferruginous ocean regions would have been a major biosphere and Earth surface reservoir through which elements passed through as part of their global biogeochemical cycles. Understanding key biological events, such as the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere, or even the transitions from ferruginous to euxinic or oxic conditions, requires understanding the biogeochemical processes occurring within ferruginous oceans, and their indicators in the rock record. Important analogs for transitions between ferruginous and oxic or euxinic conditions are paleoferruginous lakes; their sediments commonly host siderite and Ca-carbonates, which are important Precambrian records of the carbon cycling. Lakes that were ferruginous in the past, or euxinic lakes with cryptic iron cycling may also help understand transitions between ferruginous and euxinic conditions in shallow and mid-depth oceanic waters during the Proterozoic. Modern ferruginous meromictic lakes, which host diverse anaerobic microbial communities, are increasingly utilized as biogeochemical analogues for ancient ferruginous oceans. Such lakes are believed to be rare, but regional and geological factors indicate they may be more common than previously thought. While physical mixing processes in lakes and oceans are notably different, many chemical and biological processes are similar. The diversity of sizes, stratifications, and water chemistries in ferruginous lakes thus can be leveraged to explore biogeochemical controls in a range of marine systems: near-shore, off-shore, silled basins, or those dominated by terrestrial or hydrothermal element sources. Ferruginous systems, both extant and extinct, lacustrine and marine, host a continuum of biogeochemical processes that highlight the important role of iron in the evolution of Earth's surface environment.},

abstract = {a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t The last time Earth's climate experienced geologically rapid global warming was associated with the last glacial termination, when atmospheric CO 2 concentrations rose from 180 ppmv during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26-19 kaBP) to ∼260 ppmv by the early Holocene (12-8 kaBP). About one quarter of that difference is thought to be due to a stronger biological pump during glacial times, driven by increased aeolian dust deposition and hence greater iron availability in ocean surface waters. However, dust supply did not change uniformly or in synchrony over the deglacial transition and what is not known is the relative importance of different oceanic regions and how this may have changed in time. Using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, we quantify the sensitivity of atmospheric CO 2 to regional changes in iron supply, and test six different global dust reconstructions in order to explore uncertainty in past dust changes. We confirm the Southern Ocean (>34 • S) as the region most sensitive to iron fertilization, with the Atlantic and Pacific sectors accounting for about 41 ±23% and 16 ±10%, respectively, of the total CO 2 reduction from global iron fertilization. However, the North Pacific contributes 28 ± 3% to the total implying an important role for Northern Hemisphere processes in driving deglacial CO 2 rise. In addition, our analysis reveals an unexpected regional-temporal disparity, and while Southern Hemisphere iron fertilization influences atmospheric CO 2 relatively constantly throughout the termination the impact of the Northern Hemisphere only occurs during the later stages of the termination.},

abstract = {Extreme greenhouse warming in the latest Permian played a key role in the largest animal extinction event ever recorded in Earth history. The extinction was likely triggered by volcanic eruptions that dramatically increased atmospheric CO2 levels and pushed the Earth system into a lethally hot greenhouse state with stratified, anoxic and more acidic oceans. These conditions intensified a few million years later during the middle/late Smithian Thermal Maximum (STM), and a further biodiversity loss occurred during the subsequent cooling across the Smithian-Spathian boundary (SSB). The marine carbonate factory is expected to have changed during this period, but relevant studies are still lacking. Here, we report calcium isotopic data of bulk carbonate rocks ($\delta$44/40Cacarb) from two marine carbonate sections (Jiarong and Shitouzhai) in South China, showing $\sim$0.5–0.7‰ positive shift of $\delta$44/40Cacarb coupled to a $\sim$ 4–6‰ positive shift of $\delta$13Ccarb from the middle Smithian to the early Spathian. Box modeling of the marine Ca cycle yielded two scenarios (i.e., constant and variable $\delta$44/40Caseawater) that can produce a $\sim$0.5‰ positive shift of $\delta$44/40Cacarb: (1) A local mineralogical shift in primary carbonate mineralogy at both sites from 80% aragonite to 80% calcite, or (2) a >10× increase of global carbonate burial flux. The former is consistent with a $\sim$20-50-fold rise of Ca/Mg ratios and $\sim$10-50-fold decrease of Sr/Ca ratios in the study sections, and the latter fits well with massive carbonate deposition globally during the early Spathian. Oceanic overturn and upwelling of alkaline deep waters during SSB climatic cooling is proposed as the main reason for the increase in carbonate burial flux. Thus, the SSB transition marks an important step in the recovery of the marine fauna after the ddd triggered by climatic cooling, ocean ventilation, and a pronounced rise in marine carbonate deposition on continental shelves.},

abstract = {Precipitation-induced erosion and orographic precipitation are thought to be coupled during mountain building, potentially serving as a negative feedback on mountain uplift. However, the strength and spatial uniformity of this coupling are not well understood due to limitations in correlating past climate and orogenic events through proxy records, as well as the substantial differences in temporal and spatial scales at which climatic and erosional processes are typically modeled. Here, we present a novel numerical modeling framework that overcomes these order-of-magnitude differences in scale to study the co-evolution of climate, erosion, and mountain building. Our modeling framework uses asynchronous coupling and nested domains to link the National Center for Atmospheric Research Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model with Landlab, a landscape evolution model, through a hydrological model (WRF-Hydro). We conduct numerical experiments that simulate coupled climate-erosion processes during uniform surface uplift of a north-south trending mountain belt from an initial flat landscape over 5 Myrs between the latitudes 0° and 40°S in South America. Our results show that the precipitation-erosion coupling differs in strength as a function of both surface elevation and climate regime. With an increase in surface elevation and gradient, precipitation in the tropical and mid-latitude regions increases and a rain shadow forms on the leeward side of the mountain crest, while precipitation in sub-equatorial and subtropical regions exhibits little change. Erosion responds to these regional differences in precipitation and creates distinctive mean elevation, slope, and hypsometry. Our study highlights that interactions between climate and erosion have a first-order impact on mountain building over geological timescales and that it is necessary to incorporate these interactions in modeling land surface evolution.},

Yet such records are crucial to capture the diversity of regional environmental responses to global climate changes, and thus to better understand the behavior of our climate system during this critical interval. In this work, we test the potential of a multi-proxy approach ($\delta$18O, clumped isotope ($\Delta$47), strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr)) applied to bivalves recovered from the Liguro-Provencal Basin and Rhodano-Provencal basin (Northwestern of the Mediterranean Sea) to reconstruct the evolution of shallow seawater temperature and salinity in this region over the latest Oligocene to Middle Miocene interval ($\sim$10 Myrs). Our results highlight a local cooling in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea during the MMCO that contrasts with the warming observed in other regions, with seawater temperatures inferred from $\Delta$47 analyses in the 13–18 °C range. These cool seawater temperatures recorded in the studied region during the MMCO are much cooler than those recorded in the open oceans, but are in agreement with the proliferation of bryozoan observed in the Castillon-Du-Gard area during this interval. Low bivalve $\delta$18O values (−3.24‰ in average) are recorded during this episode are interpreted to reflect enhanced freshwater inputs, lowering local salinity and seawater $\delta$18O. Such enhanced freshwater inputs point to a phase of enhanced hydrological cycle in the studied region, possibly linked to the global mid-Miocene warming event. Bivalve 87Sr/86Sr data mostly fall within the global seawater Sr isotope reference curve, but remain compatible with enhanced freshwater inputs during the Aquitanian and during the Langhian, as these inputs were probably not important enough to induce a large departure from the seawater curve at a regional scale.},

abstract = {The Cenozoic inception and development of the Asian monsoons remain unclear and have generated much debate, as several hypotheses regarding circulation patterns at work in Asia during the Eocene have been proposed in the few last decades. These include (a) the existence of modern-like monsoons since the early Eocene; (b) that of a weak South Asian monsoon (SAM) and little to no East Asian monsoon (EAM); or (c) a prevalence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) migrations, also referred to as Indonesian-Australian monsoon (I-AM). As SAM and EAM are supposed to have been triggered or enhanced primarily by Asian palaeogeographic changes, their possible inception in the very dynamic Eocene palaeogeographic context remains an open question, both in the modelling and field-based communities. We investigate here Eocene Asian climate conditions using the IPSL-CM5A2 (Sepulchre et al., 2019) earth system model and revised palaeogeographies. Our Eocene climate simulation yields atmospheric circulation patterns in Asia substantially different from modern conditions. A large high-pressure area is simulated over the Tethys ocean, which generates intense low tropospheric winds blowing southward along the western flank of the proto-Himalayan-Tibetan plateau (HTP) system. This low-level wind system blocks, to latitudes lower than 10ĝˆ N, the migration of humid and warm air masses coming from the Indian Ocean. This strongly contrasts with the modern SAM, during which equatorial air masses reach a latitude of 20-25ĝˆ N over India and southeastern China. Another specific feature of our Eocene simulation is the widespread subsidence taking place over northern India in the midtroposphere (around 5000 m), preventing deep convective updraught that would transport water vapour up to the condensation level. Both processes lead to the onset of a broad arid region located over northern India and over the HTP. More humid regions of high seasonality in precipitation encircle this arid area, due to the prevalence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) migrations (or Indonesian-Australian monsoon, I-AM) rather than monsoons. Although the existence of this central arid region may partly result from the specifics of our simulation (model dependence and palaeogeographic uncertainties) and has yet to be confirmed by proxy records, most of the observational evidence for Eocene monsoons are located in the highly seasonal transition zone between the arid area and the more humid surroundings. We thus suggest that a zonal arid climate prevailed over Asia before the initiation of monsoons that most likely occurred following Eocene palaeogeographic changes. Our results also show that precipitation seasonality should be used with caution to infer the presence of a monsoonal circulation and that the collection of new data in this arid area is of paramount importance to allow the debate to move forward. .},

abstract = {During past geological times, the Earth experienced several intervals of global warmth, but their driving factors remain equivocal. A careful appraisal of the main processes controlling past warm events is essential to inform future climates and ultimately provide decision makers with a clear understanding of the processes at play in a warmer world. In this context, intervals of greenhouse climates, such as the thermal maximum of the Cenomanian-Turonian (∼ 94 Ma) during the Cretaceous Period, are of particular interest. Here we use the IPSL-CM5A2 (IPSL: Institut Pierre et Simon Laplace) Earth system model to unravel the forcing parameters of the Cenomanian-Turonian greenhouse climate. We perform six simulations with an incremental change in five major boundary conditions in order to isolate their respective role on climate change between the Cenomanian-Turonian and the preindustrial. Starting with a preindustrial simulation, we implement the following changes in boundary conditions: (1) the absence of polar ice sheets, (2) the increase in atmospheric pCO2 to 1120 ppm, (3) the change in vegetation and soil parameters, (4) the 1% decrease in the Cenomanian-Turonian value of the solar constant and (5) the Cenomanian-Turonian palaeogeography. Between the preindustrial simulation and the Cretaceous simulation, the model simulates a global warming of more than 11 C. Most of this warming is driven by the increase in atmospheric pCO2 to 1120 ppm. Palaeogeographic changes represent the second major contributor to global warming, whereas the reduction in the solar constant counteracts most of geographically driven warming. We further demonstrate that the implementation of Cenomanian-Turonian boundary conditions flattens meridional temperature gradients compared to the preindustrial simulation. Interestingly, we show that palaeogeography is the major driver of the flattening in the low latitudes to midlatitudes, whereas pCO2 rise and polar ice sheet retreat dominate the highlatitude response.},

abstract = {The consequences for the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of fundamentally different assumptions about the vertical effective diffusivity of heat and salt (kv) are examined in a zonally averaged model of the buoyancy-driven flow in one- and two-hemisphere basins. First, we replicate results obtained in earlier studies from a zonally averaged model based on a less elaborate closure for the zonal pressure difference. For a single-hemisphere basin, the equilibrium response of the MOC to freshwater forcing (salt addition at low latitudes and salt extraction at high latitudes) depends qualitatively on the nature of vertical mixing: if the diffusivity is constant (a common assumption), the MOC decreases with increased forcing, whereas if it depends on vertical density stratification (at least an equally plausible assumption) the MOC increases with increased forcing. For a two-hemisphere basin, on the other hand, the equilibrium response of the MOC in the dominant hemisphere to increased freshwater forcing (symmetric about the equator) is an amplification for both mixing representations. Second, we investigate the instability of the flow at large freshwater forcing. For both basins, the flow is more stable to the forcing if kv varies with vertical stratification. For a single-hemisphere basin, self-sustained oscillations of the flow that are quasi-periodic (e.g., millennial) are found for both fixed and stability-dependent kv. For a two-hemisphere basin, such oscillations are found only when kv is stability-dependent. For both basins, the occurrence and period of the oscillations are partly determined by the energy available for vertical mixing if kv varies with vertical stratification. A possible analogy with the relaxation oscillations of van der Pol is presented.},

abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity, the global surface temperature response to CO CO2 doubling, has been persistently uncertain. Recent consensus places it likely within 1.5–4.5 K. Global climate models (GCMs), which attempt to represent all relevant physical processes, provide the most direct means of estimating climate sensitivity via CO2 quadrupling experiments. Here we show that the closely related effective climate sensitivity has increased substantially in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), with values spanning 1.8–5.6 K across 27 GCMs and exceeding 4.5 K in 10 of them. This (statistically insignificant) increase is primarily due to stronger positive cloud feedbacks from decreasing extratropical low cloud coverage and albedo. Both of these are tied to the physical representation of clouds which in CMIP6 models lead to weaker responses of extratropical low cloud cover and water content to unforced variations in surface temperature. Establishing the plausibility of these higher sensitivity models is imperative given their implied societal ramifications.},

abstract = {We present the global general circulation model IPSL-CM5 developed to study the long-term response of the climate system to natural and anthropogenic forcings as part of the 5th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This model includes an interactive carbon cycle, a representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, and a comprehensive representation of aerosols. As it represents the principal dynamical, physical, and bio-geochemical processes relevant to the climate system, it may be referred to as an Earth System Model. However, the IPSL-CM5 model may be used in a multitude of configurations associated with different boundary conditions and with a range of complexities in terms of processes and interactions. This paper presents an overview of the different model components and explains how they were coupled and used to simulate historical climate changes over the past 150 years and different scenarios of future climate change. A single version of the IPSL-CM5 model (IPSL-CM5A-LR) was used to provide climate projections associated with different socio-economic scenarios, including the different Representative Concentration Pathways considered by CMIP5 and several scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios considered by CMIP3. Results suggest that the magnitude of global warming projections primarily depends on the socio-economic scenario considered, that there is potential for an aggressive mitigation policy to limit global warming to about two degrees, and that the behavior of some components of the climate system such as the Arctic sea ice and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation may change drastically by the end of the twenty-first century in the case of a no climate policy scenario. Although the magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes depends fairly linearly on the magnitude of the projected global warming (and thus on the scenario considered), the geographical pattern of these changes is strikingly similar for the different scenarios. The representation of atmospheric physical processes in the model is shown to strongly influence the simulated climate variability and both the magnitude and pattern of the projected climate changes. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

This model incorporates the various types of ice flow found in Antarctica: relatively slow inland ice flow that is essentially due to ice deformation, fast ice flow in the regions with ice streams, and ice shelf flow. By coupling these three types of flow, it is possible to predict grounding line migration. Simulations covering four glacial-interglacial cycles have been conducted by forcing this model with a temperature record from Vostok and a sea level record from marine cores. Our findings indicate that grounding line migration induced by sea level changes is the primary factor governing the evolution of the Antarctic ice volume. On the other hand, the altitude of the ice sheet surface at Vostok is driven by accumulation rate variations. The amplitude of the altitude change does not exceed 150 m and is very similar for all the sites located on the Antarctic Plateau. Copyright 2001 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 exerts a robust and well-documented control on Earth's climate, but the timing of glaciation during the late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA; ca. 360-260 Ma) is inconsistent with pCO2 reconstructions, hinting at another factor. Stratospheric volcanic aerosols produce a large but temporary negative radiative forcing under modern conditions. Here we examine explosive volcanism over 200 m.y. of Earth history to show that the LPIA corresponded with a sustained increase in volcanism in both tropical and extratropical latitudes. A major peak in explosive volcanism at ca. 300 Ma likely corresponded to stratospheric sulfur-injecting eruptions at least three to eight times more frequent than at present. This level of volcanism created a steady, negative radiative forcing potentially sufficient to initiate and, most critically, sustain icehouse conditions, even under increasing levels of pCO2, and helps resolve discrepancies between glacial timing and CO2 records. Accounting for the radiative forcing effects of CO2 and sulfate indicates that both are required to explain the LPIA, with sulfate producing an especially strong effect at peak icehouse ca. 298-295 Ma. Frequent explosive volcanism would have increased atmospheric acidity, enhancing the reactivity of iron in abundant volcanic ash and glacially generated mineral dust, thus strengthening the climate impact of volcanism through a marine biological pump further primed by feedback with glaciation.},

Among them, a global Smithian-negative carbonate carbon isotope excursion has been identified, followed by an abrupt increase across the Smithian-Spathian boundary (SSB; $\sim$250.8 Myr ago). This chemostratigraphic evolution is associated with palaeontological evidence that indicate a major collapse of terrestrial and marine ecosystems during the Late Smithian. It is commonly assumed that Smithian and Spathian isotopic variations are intimately linked to major perturbations in the exogenic carbon reservoir. We present paired carbon isotopes measurements from the Thaynes Group (Utah, USA) to evaluate the extent to which the Early Triassic isotopic perturbations reflect changes in the exogenic carbon cycle. The $\delta$13Ccarb variations obtained here reproduce the known Smithian $\delta$13Ccarb-negative excursion. However, the $\delta$13C signal of the bulk organic matter is invariant across the SSB and variations in the $\delta$34S signal of sedimentary sulphides are interpreted here to reflect the intensity of sediment remobilization. We argue that Middle to Late Smithian $\delta$13Ccarb signal in the shallow marine environments of the Thaynes Group does not reflect secular evolution of the exogenic carbon cycle but rather physicochemical conditions at the sediment-water interface leading to authigenic carbonate formation during early diagenetic processes.},

By coupling geochemical palaeoredox proxies with a record of organic-walled fossils from exceptionally well-defined successions of the early Cambrian Baltic Basin, we provide evidence for the early establishment of modern-type oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). Both inner-and outer-shelf environments were pervasively oxygenated, whereas mid-depth settings were characterised by spatially oscillating anoxia. As such, conflicting redox signatures recovered from individual sites most likely derive from sampling bias, whereby anoxic conditions represent mid-shelf environments with higher productivity. This picture of a spatially restricted anoxic wedge contrasts with prevailing models of globally stratified oceans, offering a more nuanced and realistic account of the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic ocean transition.},

We find a global transition from sulphidic to ferruginous mid-depth waters in the earliest Neoproterozoic, coincident with the amalgamation of the supercontinent Rodinia at low latitudes. We suggest that ferruginous conditions were initiated by an increase in the oceanic influx of highly reactive iron relative to sulphate, driven by a change in weathering regime and the uptake of sulphate by extensive continental evaporites on Rodinia. We proposethat this transition essentially detoxified oceanmargin settings, allowing for expanded opportunities for eukaryote diversification followingaprolonged evolutionary stasis before one billion years ago.},

Here we show <2.31 Ga sedimentary barium sulfates (barites) from the Turee Creek Basin, W. Australia with positive sulfur isotope anomalies of ∆33S up to + 1.55‰ and low $\delta$18O down to −19.5‰. The unequivocal origin of this combination of signals is sulfide oxidation in meteoric water. Geochemical and sedimentary evidence suggests that these S-isotope anomalies were transferred from the paleo-continent under an oxygenated atmosphere. Our findings indicate that incipient oxidative continental weathering, ca. 2.8–2.5 Ga or earlier, may be diagnosed with such a combination of low $\delta$18O and high ∆33S in sulfates.},

abstract = {The approximately 2,220–2,060 million years old Lomagundi–Jatuli Event was the longest positive carbon isotope excursion in Earth history and is traditionally interpreted to reflect an increased organic carbon burial and a transient rise in atmospheric O2. However, it is widely held that O2 levels collapsed for more than a billion years after this. Here we show that black shales postdating the Lomagundi–Jatuli Event from the approximately 2,000 million years old Zaonega Formation contain the highest redox-sensitive trace metal concentrations reported in sediments deposited before the Neoproterozoic (maximum concentrations of Mo = 1,009 $\mu$g g−1, U = 238 $\mu$g g−1 and Re = 516 ng g−1). This unit also contains the most positive Precambrian shale U isotope values measured to date (maximum 238U/235U ratio of 0.79‰), which provides novel evidence that there was a transition to modern-like biogeochemical cycling during the Palaeoproterozoic. Although these records do not preclude a return to anoxia during the Palaeoproterozoic, they uniquely suggest that the oceans remained well-oxygenated millions of years after the termination of the Lomagundi–Jatuli Event.},

abstract = {The sedimentary rock reservoir both records and influences changes in Earth's surface environment. Geoscientists extract data from the rock record to constrain long-term environmental, climatic and biological evolution, with the understanding that geological processes of erosion and rock destruction may have overprinted some aspects of their results. It has also long been recognized that changes in the mass and chemical composition of buried sediments, operating in conjunction with biologically catalyzed reactions, exert a first-order control on Earth surface conditions on geologic timescales. Thus, the construction and destruction of the rock record has the potential to influence both how Earth and life history are sampled, and drive long-term trends in surface conditions that otherwise are difficult to affect. However, directly testing what the dominant process signal in the sedimentary record is — rock construction or destruction — has rarely been undertaken, primarily due to the difficulty of assembling data on the mass and age of rocks in Earth's crust. Here, we present results on the chronological age and general properties of rocks and sediments in the Macrostrat geospatial database (https://macrostrat.org). Empirical patterns in surviving rock quantity as a function of age are indicative of both continual cycling (gross sedimentation) and long-term sediment accumulation (net sedimentation). Temporal variation in the net sedimentary reservoir was driven by major changes in the ability of continental crust to accommodate sediments. The implied history of episodic growth of sediment mass on continental crust has many attendant implications for the drivers of long-term biogeochemical evolution of Earth and life.},

It is unique among global, public access databases in that it is a section-based online database system, incorporating data from a wide range of disciplines of stratigraphy and paleontology, with inherent interrelationship between different kinds of data sets. It provides the capability of completely digitizing raw data, as well as integrating of different interpretations to the same paleontological and stratigraphic content. Several Windows-based visualization and analysis applications, either fully integrated with the database or supported by subset-export functions, have been developed to make the database more useful as a scientific and educational tool.

Here, we integrate physiological, climatic, and biogeographic data to calibrate and then map a key metabolic index—the ratio of O2 supply to resting metabolic O2 demand—across geographic ranges of several marine ectotherms. These species differ in thermal and hypoxic tolerances, but their contemporary distributions are all bounded at the equatorward edge by a minimum metabolic index of $\sim$2 to 5, indicative of a critical energetic requirement for organismal activity. The combined effects of warming and O2 loss this century are projected to reduce the upper ocean's metabolic index by $\sim$20% globally and by $\sim$50% in northern high-latitude regions, forcing poleward and vertical contraction of metabolically viable habitats and species ranges.},

Although it has been long appreciated that these major tectonic, climatic, and biotic events left their signature on seawater 87Sr/86Sr through their influence on Sr fluxes to the ocean, the temporal resolution and precision of the late Paleozoic seawater 87Sr/86Sr record remain relatively low. Here we present a high-temporal-resolution and high-fidelity record of Carboniferous- early Permian seawater 87Sr/86Sr based on conodont bioapatite from an open-water carbonate slope succession in south China. The new data define a rate of long-term rise in 87Sr/86Sr (0.000035/m.y.) from ca. 334-318 Ma comparable to that of the middle to late Cenozoic. The onset of the rapid decline in 87Sr/86Sr (0.000043/m.y.), following a prolonged plateau (318-303 Ma), is constrained to ca. 303 Ma. A major decoupling of 87Sr/86Sr and pCO2 during 303-297 Ma, coincident with the Paleozoic peak in pO2, widespread low-latitude aridification, and demise of the pan-tropical wetland forests, suggests a major shift in the dominant influence on pCO2 from continental weathering and organic carbon sequestration (as coals) on land to organic carbon burial in the ocean.},

State-of-the-art counting protocols, and sampling standardization functions permit the reconstruction of biologically meaningful time series. Additional functions permit the partitioning of turnover rates by environmental affinity. Using divDyn, we display Phanerozoic-scale diversity dynamics of marine invertebrates. With the help of the core function and standard subsampling options, we revisit the hypothesis of declining taxonomic rates over time, mass extinctions and equilibrial diversity dynamics and assess their methodological dependency. Our results suggest that rates declined only over the early Phanerozoic, only three mass extinctions stand out clearly, and evidence of equilibrial dynamics is dependent on the used methods. The modular and fast implementation of published methods ensures traceability, reproducibility and comparability of future studies.},

abstract = {Earth's last icehouse, 300 million years ago, is considered the longest-lived and most acute of the past half-billion years, characterized by expansive continental ice sheets and possibly tropical low-elevation glaciation. This atypical climate has long been attributed to anomalous radiative forcing promoted by a 3% lower incident solar luminosity and sustained low atmospheric p CO2 (≤300 ppm). Climate models, however, indicate a CO2 sensitivity of ice-sheet distribution and sea-level response that questions this long-standing climate paradigm by revealing major discrepancy between hypothesized ice distribution, p CO2, and geologic records of glacioeustasy. Here we present a high-resolution record of atmospheric p CO2 for 16 million years of the late Palaeozoic, developed using soil carbonate-based and fossil leaf-based proxies, that resolves the climate conundrum. Palaeo-fluctuations on the 10 5 -yr scale occur within the CO2 range predicted for anthropogenic change and co-vary with substantial change in sea level and ice volume. We further document coincidence between p CO2 changes and repeated restructuring of Euramerican tropical forests that, in conjunction with modelled vegetation shifts, indicate a more dynamic carbon sequestration history than previously considered and a major role for terrestrial vegetation-CO2 feedbacks in driving eccentricity-scale climate cycles of the late Palaeozoic icehouse.},

abstract = {The Late Ordovician to early Silurian (O/S) was an important period in which many significant geological events occurred. During the O/S transition, organic-rich black shales were widely deposited and became important unconventional energy sources. Paleoproductivity, detrital input, and redox conditions are the three major factors controlling organic matter (OM) accumulation. Although the effect of each factor is relatively clear, the complex influences of these factors remain poorly understood. Specifically, the evolution of these factors and the corresponding influence on the accumulation of OM during the O/S transition has not yet been systematically investigated. This paper investigates the constraints on OM accumulation in O/S transition black shales from the Lower Yangtze region, based on graptolite fossil identification, zircon U–Pb dating, and geochemical analyses of a well sequenced drilling profile. The results show that (i) the SY-1 core sequence was well constrained from graptolite zones WF2 (447.62 Ma) to LM5 (441.57 Ma) across the O/S boundary, with decreasing sedimentation rates (SRs) in the upper Katian (WF2 to WF3) and increasing SRs in the lower Rhuddanian; (ii) complementary volcanic inputs (Katian and Rhuddanian) and upwelling events (Hirnantian) exerted strong control over paleoproductivity; (iii) orogenic processes in South China controlled detrital inputs and redox conditions; (iv) OM accumulation in the Lower Yangtze area across the O/S transition occurred in three stages. In stage 1 (WF2–WF3), strong volcanism boosted productivity, whereas OM preservation was not favored in the oxic environment. In stage 2 (WF4–LM3), upwelling and volcanism resulted in high productivity and provided the optimal configurations for OM enrichment. In stage 3 (LM4 and later), rare OM was preserved due to terrestrial dilution and unfavorable preservation conditions. Eventually, WF4–LM3 became the prominent OM-rich biozones due to the effective coordination of the controlling factors, namely upwelling, volcanism, and redox conditions.},

The interregnum, however, between the Cambrian Explosion and the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event, is exemplified by the Furongian Gap when there was a marked drop in biodiversity. It is unclear whether the gap is apparent, due to sampling failure or lack of rock, or real — associated with unique and fluctuating environments, a distinctive palaeogeography and extreme climates during the late Cambrian. Indications suggest that there has been little attention paid to this interval compared with those below and above, while some of the classical areas for Cambrian research, such as Bohemia, have poor coverage through the Furongian. Moreover, based on information available in databases and the literature, together with the ghost ranges of many higher taxa through the Furongian, data suggest that biodiversity in this stage has been significantly underestimated. Emphasis, to date, has been placed on widespread, deeper-water dark shale facies of the interval, with generally low diversity faunas, whereas shallow-water communities have often been neglected.},

abstract = {The Tremadocian (Early Ordovician) is currently considered a time span of greenhouse conditions with tropical water surface temperature estimates, interpolated from oxygen isotopes, approaching 40 °C. In the mid-latitude Baltoscandian Basin, conodonts displaying low $\delta$ 18 O values, which suggest high temperatures (>40 °C) in the water column, are in contrast with the discovery of contemporaneous glendonite clusters, a pseudomorph of ikaite (CaCO 3 {\textperiodcentered}6H 2 O) traditionally considered as indicator of near-freezing bottom-water conditions. The massive precipitation of this temperature sensitive mineral is associated with transgressive conditions and high organic productivity. As a result, the lower Tremadocian sediments of Baltoscandia apparently contain both “greenhouse” pelagic signals and near-freezing substrate indicators. This paradox points to other primary controlling mechanisms for ikaite precipitation in kerogenous substrates, such as carbonate alkalinity, pH and Mg/Ca ratios, as recently constrained by laboratory experiments. Preservation of “hot” conodonts embedded in kerogenous shales rich in $\delta$ 18 O-depleted glendonites suggests both the onset of sharp thermal stratification patterns in a semi-closed basin and the assumed influence of isotopically depleted freshwater yielded by fluvial systems.},

abstract = {The role of mountains in the geological evolution of the carbon cycle has been intensively debated for the last decades. Mountains are thought to increase the local physical erosion, which in turns promotes silicate weathering, organic carbon transport and burial, and release of sulfuric acid by dissolution of sulfides. In this contribution, we explore the impact of mountain ranges on silicate weathering. Mountains modify the global pattern of atmospheric circulation as well as the local erosion conditions. Using an IPCC-class climate model, we first estimate the climatic impact of mountains by comparing the present day climate with the climate when all the continents are assumed to be flat. We then use these climate output to calculate weathering changes when mountains are present or absent, using standard expression for physical erosion and a 1D vertical model for rock weathering. We found that large-scale climate changes and enhanced rock supply by erosion due to mountain uplift have opposite effect, with similar orders of magnitude. A thorough testing of the weathering model parameters by data-model comparison shows that best-fit parameterizations lead to a decrease of weathering rate in the absence of mountain by about 20%. However, we demonstrate that solutions predicting an increase in weathering in the absence of mountain cannot be excluded. A clear discrimination between the solutions predicting an increase or a decrease in global weathering is pending on the improvement of the existing global databases for silicate weathering. Nevertheless, imposing a constant and homogeneous erosion rate for models without relief, we found that weathering decrease becomes unequivocal for very low erosion rates (below 10 t/km2/yr). We conclude that further monitoring of continental silicate weathering should be performed with a spatial distribution allowing to discriminate between the various continental landscapes (mountains, plains {\ldots}).},

abstract = {The effects of orography on climate are investigated with a coupled ocean–atmosphere general circulation model (IPSL-CM5). Results are compared with previous investigations in order to dig out robust consequences of the lack of orography on the global scale. Emphasis is made on the thermohaline circulation whose sensitivity to orography has only been subject to a very limited number of studies using coupled models. The removal of the entire orography switches the Meridional Overturning Circulation from the Atlantic to the Pacific, following freshwater transfers from the latter to the former that reverse the salinity gradient between these oceans. This is in part due to the increased freshwater export from the Pacific to the Atlantic through North America in the absence of the Rocky Mountains and the consecutive decreased evaporation in the North Atlantic once the Atlantic MOC weakens, which cools the northern high-latitudes. In addition and unlike previous model studies, we find that tropical freshwater transfers are a major driver of this switch. More precisely, the collapse of the Asian summer monsoon, associated with westward freshwater transfer across Africa, is critical to the freshening of the Atlantic and the increased salt content in the Pacific. Specifically, precipitations are increasing over the Congo catchment area and induce a strong increase in runoff discharging into the tropical Atlantic. In addition, the removal of the Andes shifts the area of strong precipitation toward the Amazonian catchment area and results in a larger runoff discharging into the Tropical Atlantic.},

abstract = {The equator to high southern latitude sea surface and vertical temperature gradients are reconstructed from oxygen isotope values of planktonic and benthic foraminifers for the following five time intervals: late Paleocene, early Eocene, early middle Eocene, late Eocene, and early Oligocene. Paleotemperatures are calculated using standard oxygen isotope/temperature equations with adjustments to account for (1) variations in sea water $\delta$18O related to changes in global ice volume over time and (2) latitudinal gradients in surface water $\delta$18O. These reconstructions indicate that sea‐surface temperatures (SST) of the Southern Oceans in the early Eocene were as high as 15°C, whereas temperatures during the late Paleocene and early middle Eocene reached maximum levels of 10°–12°C. By the late Eocene and early Oligocene high latitude SST had declined to 6 and 4°C, respectively. For most of the early Paleogene, low latitude sub‐tropical temperatures remained constant and well within the range of Holocene temperatures (24°ndash;25°C) but by the late Eocene and early Oligocene declined to values in the range of 18° to 22°C. The late Paleogene apparent decline in tropical temperatures, however, might be artificial because of dissolution of near‐surface foraminifera tests which biased sediment assemblages toward deeper‐dwelling foraminifera. Moreover, according to recent plate reconstructions, it appears that the majority of sites upon which the late Eocene and early Oligocene tropical temperatures were previously established were located either in or near regions likely to have been influenced by upwelling. Global deepwater temperature on average paralleled southern ocean SST for most of the Paleogene. We speculate based on the overall timing and character of marine sea surface temperature variation during the Paleogene that some combination of both higher levels of greenhouse gases and increased heat transport was responsible for the exceptional high‐latitude warmth of the early Eocene.

abstract = {A cooling trend during the Middle Ordovician may have resulted in significant biotic, atmospheric and hydrologic changes, but the exact timing and forcing of this climate event still remain largely ambiguous. Here, we present astronomically calibrated magnetic susceptibility (MS) and gamma ray (GR) data from the shale and carbonate successions of the Kalpin area in the Tarim Basin, NW China to study the Middle Ordovician climate. The spectral analyses of the 405-kyr calibrated MS and GR time series reveal periodicities close to 405 (calibrated), 100, 31 and 19 kyr, supporting a Milankovitch forcing for the sedimentary cyclicity. The eccentricity and obliquity amplitude modulation cycles show main periodicities of $\sim$2.4 and $\sim$1.2 Myr, respectively. A cooling event along with the middle Darriwilian isotope carbon excursion (MDICE) appears to have been initiated by the alignment of the eccentricity and obliquity amplitude minima at 4.07 Myr prior to the Darriwilian/Sandbian (D/S) boundary. This climate event was in pace with high-amplitude obliquity oscillations during a period when the 1.2 Myr obliquity amplitude modulation cycles controlled the global third-order eustatic sequences. The termination of this cooling event corresponding to a global third-order highstand was initiated by an eccentricity oscillation maximum at 0.63 Myr prior to the D/S boundary. Subsequent climate alleviation was dominated by eccentricity forcing until the earliest Sandbian. We suggest that although the climate changes have been primarily associated with the CO2 level, a specific sequence of astronomical variations during the Middle Ordovician was responsible for the time when the critical threshold was crossed.},

abstract = {The stratigraphic distributions, taxonomy, diversity, evolutionary lineages and events of late Cambrian to Middle Ordovician euconodonts of Baltica are briefly reviewed and re-evaluated. The euconodonts of the late Furongian (Stage 10, late Cambrian) to Middle Ordovician successions of Baltica record innovation, immigration and two invasions of short duration and one major extinction. The innovation event with an origin on Baltica is the rise of the Proconodontus serratus lineage in the late Furongian (Stage 10). The immigration events comprise the Cordylodus immigration to Baltoscandia in latest Cambrian and this phylogenetic lineage persisted to mid-Tremadocian (Early Ordovician) and vanished at the global mid-Tremadocian extinction event. The late Floian – basal Dapingian transition is a significant event on Baltica. It is characterized by the immigration of the important genera Baltoniodus and Microzarkodina and upon their arrival these taxa remained on the Baltica palaeocontinent and stayed for a long period forming evolutionary lineages. The basal Darriwilian immigration event by the genus Lenodus and coeval prominent sea-level lowstand were caused by a short global icehouse stage related to the expansion of the polar ice sheets. The extinction event caused the disappearance of the characteristic Cordylodus fauna. Most events are related to changes in the palaeoclimate resulting from the movement of the Baltica palaecontinent and associated eustatic sea-level changes. However, the cause of the global early Tremadocian extinction event is not yet completely clear and remains unsolved. Perhaps abrupt and significant palaeoceanographic changes on a global scale (i.e., plate tectonic movements causing sudden change of ocean currents and climate from warm to cold) were the cause of this significant extinction in the Early Ordovician.},

abstract = {The rare Middle Ordovician brachiopod genus Ukoa has remained unassigned to any existing family. The original description by {\"{O}}pik in 1932 was based primarily on the external morphology; all later revisions of the genus also lack information regarding the interior of the dorsal valve, as well as information on the shell ultrastructure. As these are critical morphological features for designating a placement within the superfamily Plectambonitoidea – or indeed the order Strophomenida – not even a higher-level taxonomical determination has hitherto been attempted for Ukoa. The current study has examined new material, as well as museum specimens, that allowed for an analysis of the shell ultrastructure confirming the genus placement within the plectambonitoids. Moreover, as dorsal cardinalia are preserved in one of the new specimens, we further place Ukoa within the family Taffiidae Schuchert and Cooper, 1931, assigned to a new subfamily, the Ukoainae n. subfam. This corresponds well with the stratigraphic range of the Taffiidae, and as such, Ukoa, therefore represents yet another short-ranged plectambonitoid genus that originated during the Middle Ordovician Darriwilian Stage. As this coincides with both the onset of the main phase of the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) and suddenly cooling climate, the current study also reviews the early diversification of the Plectambonitoidea within that context. Based on a specific focus on Baltica, we suggest that the unusual morphology that characterizes the plectambonitoids could be a particularly successful functional morphological adaptation to the unfolding Darriwilian ice age. As sea level dropped – possibly in the same order of magnitude as that experienced during the Quaternary glaciations – increased siliciclastic input washed onto the epicontinental seas globally providing muddy substrates, and thus new ecospace for the plectambonitoids to exploit and utilize during the early Darriwilian sea-level lowstands. The millennial glacioeustatic oscillations further accelerated plectambonitoid diversity through multiple allopatric speciation events, contributing to the overall accumulation of biodiversity that characterises the GOBE.},

abstract = {The early Bajocian event was characterized by a protracted, ca. 4 Myr-long positive carbon isotope excursion that has been recognized in both marine and continental records. It is concomitant with a marine eutrophication event that led to regional demises of the neritic carbonate factory, as well as floral and faunal turnovers. The ultimate cause and modality of this event remains uncertain. In this study, we present a high-resolution, biostratigraphically calibrated, bulk organic matter carbon isotope dataset derived from the marine sedimentary record of the Central High Atlas Basin in Morocco and spanning the upper Aalenian–lower upper Bajocian. Within the context of the overall lower Bajocian positive carbon isotope excursion, this curve displays a complex trend of subordinated positive and negative shifts, which can be correlated to the high-resolution bulk carbonate carbon isotope record of southeastern France and southern Spain. The presence of a similar complex shape in these carbon isotope records over a large paleogeographic area highlights that the carbon cycle perturbation associated with the early Bajocian event was more intricate than previously depicted. Using the difference in carbon isotope fractionation between the carbonate and organic matter records as a first-order tracer of atmospheric pCO2 variations implies that the late early Bajocian was characterized by two interludes (late Propinquans and late Humphriesianum chronozones) of low greenhouse gas concentrations. This inference is supported by high-resolution paleotemperature and global sea-level records, suggesting the transient development of polar ice caps during the Middle Jurassic.},

abstract = {Valentine and Moores [Valentine JW, Moores EM (1970) Nature 228:657-659] hypothesized that plate tectonics regulates global biodiversity by changing the geographic arrangement of continental crust, but the data required to fully test the hypothesis were not available. Here, we use a global database of marine animal fossil occurrences and a paleogeographic reconstruction model to test the hypothesis that temporal patterns of continental fragmentation have impacted global Phanerozoic biodiversity. We find a positive correlation between global marine invertebrate genus richness and an independently derived quantitative index describing the fragmentation of continental crust during supercontinental coalescence-breakup cycles. The observed positive correlation between global biodiversity and continental fragmentation is not readily attributable to commonly cited vagaries of the fossil record, including changing quantities of marine rock or time-variable sampling effort. Because many different environmental and biotic factors may covary with changes in the geographic arrangement of continental crust, it is difficult to identify a specific causal mechanism. However, cross-correlation indicates that the state of continental fragmentation at a given time is positively correlated with the state of global biodiversity for tens of millions of years afterward. There is also evidence to suggest that continental fragmentation promotes increasing marine richness, but that coalescence alone has only a small negative or stabilizing effect. Together, these results suggest that continental fragmentation, particularly during the Mesozoic breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea, has exerted a first-order control on the long-term trajectory of Phanerozoic marine animal diversity.},

Long-term diversification is associated with decreasing origination and extinction rates, and with increasing taxon longevity. Here we use the diversification trajectories of skeletal non-colonial marine families to infer the mechanisms that generated these trends. Suggested mechanisms behind these trends include stochastic extinction of taxa with high evolutionary volatility and selection for traits that buffer against extinction. We find an increasing predominance of Phanerozoic families with long lag times between first appearance and peak diversity, over those with ‘early burst' diversification trajectories. Long-lag families persisted for longer and had lower evolutionary volatilities, higher genus-level occupancies and genera with larger niche breadths than early burst families. However, they do not preferentially show ecological modes known to protect against extinction. We interpret the rise of the long-lag families as reflecting an intensification of ecosystem-level mechanisms supporting both long-term coexistence and transient dynamics, which increased the capacity of marine ecosystems to accommodate highly diverse communities.},

abstract = {The greatest relative changes in marine biodiversity accumulation occurred during the Early Paleozoic. The precision of temporal constraints on these changes is crude, hampering our understanding of their timing, duration, and links to causal mechanisms. We match fossil occurrence data to their lithostratigraphical ranges in the Paleobiology Database and correlate this inferred taxon range to a constructed set of biostratigraphically defined high-resolution time slices. In addition, we apply capture–recapture modeling approaches to calculate a biodiversity curve that also considers ta-phonomy and sampling biases with four times better resolution of previous estimates. Our method reveals a stepwise biodiversity increase with distinct Cambrian and Ordovician radiation events that are clearly separated by a 50-million-year-long period of slow biodiversity accumulation. The Ordovician Radiation is confined to a 15-million-year phase after which the Late Ordovician extinctions lowered generic richness and further delayed a biodiversity rebound by at least 35 million years. Based on a first-differences approach on potential abiotic drivers controlling richness, we find an overall correlation with oxygen levels, with temperature also exhibiting a coordinated trend once equatorial sea surface temperatures fell to present-day levels during the Middle Ordovician Darriwilian Age. Contrary to the traditional view of the Late Ordovician extinctions, our study suggests a protracted crisis interval linked to intense volcanism during the middle Late Ordovician Katian Age. As richness levels did not return to prior levels during the Silurian—a time of continental amalgamation—we further argue that plate tectonics exerted an overarching control on biodiversity accumulation.},

abstract = { Falling atmospheric CO 2 levels led to cooling through the Eocene and the expansion of Antarctic ice sheets close to their modern size near the beginning of the Oligocene, a period of poorly documented climate. Here, we present a record of climate evolution across the entire Oligocene (33.9 to 23.0 Ma) based on TEX 86 sea surface temperature (SST) estimates from southwestern Atlantic Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 516 (paleolatitude ∼36°S) and western equatorial Atlantic Ocean Drilling Project Site 929 (paleolatitude ∼0°), combined with a compilation of existing SST records and climate modeling. In this relatively low CO 2 Oligocene world (∼300 to 700 ppm), warm climates similar to those of the late Eocene continued with only brief interruptions, while the Antarctic ice sheet waxed and waned. SSTs are spatially heterogenous, but generally support late Oligocene warming coincident with declining atmospheric CO 2 . This Oligocene warmth, especially at high latitudes, belies a simple relationship between climate and atmospheric CO 2 and/or ocean gateways, and is only partially explained by current climate models. Although the dominant climate drivers of this enigmatic Oligocene world remain unclear, our results help fill a gap in understanding past Cenozoic climates and the way long-term climate sensitivity responded to varying background climate states. },

abstract = {An ocean iodine cycling model is presented, which predicts upper ocean iodine speciation. The model comprises a three-layer advective and diffusive ocean circulation model of the upper ocean and an iodine cycling model embedded within this circulation. The two primary reservoirs of iodine are represented, iodide and iodate. Iodate is reduced to iodide in the mixed layer in association with primary production, linked by an iodine to carbon (I:C) ratio. A satisfactory model fit with observations cannot be obtained with a globally constant I:C ratio, and the best fit is obtained when the I:C ratio is dependent on sea surface temperature, increasing at low temperatures. Comparisons with observed iodide distributions show that the best model fit is obtained when oxidation of iodide back to iodate is associated with mixed layer nitrification. Sensitivity tests, where model parameters and processes are perturbed, reveal that primary productivity, mixed layer depth, oxidation, advection, surface freshwater flux, and the I:C ratio all have a role in determining surface iodide concentrations, and the timescale of iodide in the mixed layer is sufficiently long for nonlocal processes to be important. Comparisons of the modeled iodide surface field with parameterizations by other authors show good agreement in regions where observations exist but significant differences in regions without observations. This raises the question of whether the existing parameterizations are capturing the full range of processes involved in determining surface iodide and shows the urgent need for observations in regions where there are currently none.},

abstract = {A drive to improve long-term estimates of atmospheric CO2 change through Earths history has led to the development of novel paleoproxy CO2 methods applicable to fossil plants. This paper compares two of these paleoproxy CO2 methods (1) the empirical model of Schubert and Jahren (2012, 2015) termed the C3 plant proxy, which was developed using the hyperbolic relationship observed between plant carbon isotope discrimination ($\Delta$13C) and pCO2 and (2) the mechanistic model of Franks et al. (2014), which utilizes stomatal anatomy measurements and plant carbon isotopic composition and is based on established equations for leaf gas exchange and photosynthesis. To date both models lack detailed experimental testing of the robustness and accuracy of their pCO2 predictions in relation to phylogenetic differences in $\Delta$13C between C3 plant groups and/or species and atmospheric O2 concentration, which has co-fluctuated with CO2 in the geological past. Here, we investigate if these novel paleoproxy CO2 approaches can produce phylogenetically independent estimates of pCO2 that are not influenced by variations in atmospheric oxygen. To address this, model estimates of pCO2 were compared with measured CO2 values for ten plant species representing four major vascular plant groups (lycophytes, monilophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms) grown for 6 months in walk-in plant growth chambers under varying O2:CO2 ratios. Results from the mechanistic model reveal that species-specific plant responses to atmospheric CO2 accounted for the large variability in CO2 predictions between species and overestimations of pCO2 by ∼+232 ppm to 940 ppm. Adjustments to the model that involved: (1) corrections to the photorespiratory compensation point (to account for fluctuating oxygen) and (2) removal of the phylogenetic effect on $\Delta$13C, reduced between-species variability (by 50%) and led to better pCO2 estimates within 58–229 ppm of measured values. The C3 plant proxy (empirical approach) produced accurate CO2 estimates within +37 to +71 ppm of measured values, however it was affected by species-specific differences in $\Delta$13C and for some species resulted in negative estimates of pCO2. Sub-ambient O2 (16%) resulted in erroneously high CO2 estimates (∼100 ppm higher than the control) for a number of species, as plant responses to decreasing O2 mimicked those of increasing CO2. We conclude that both models (with phylogenetic corrections to Franks et al. (2014)) can produce accurate estimates of paleo-CO2 when a mix of three to four species, preferably containing representatives from both pteridophytes and spermatophytes, is used to obtain a consensus pCO2 estimate. We advocate a fossil assemblage rather than a single-species approach to paleo-CO2 estimation in future application of either method.},

abstract = {The latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) through earliest Paleogene (Danian) interval was a time marked by one of the five major mass extinctions in Earth's history. The synthesis of published data permits the temporal correlation of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary crisis with two major geological events: (1) the Chicxulub impact, discovered in the Yucat{\'{a}}n Peninsula (Mexico), and (2) eruption of the Deccan Traps large igneous province, located on the west-central Indian plateau. In this study, environmental and biological consequences from the Chicxulub impact and emplacement of the Deccan continental flood basalts were explored using a climate-carbon-biodiversity coupled model called the ECO-GEOCLIM model. The novelty of this study was investigation into the ways in which abiotic factors (temperature, pH, and calcite saturation state) acted on various marine organisms to determine the primary productivity and biodiversity changes in response to a drastic environmental change. Results showed that the combination of Deccan volcanism with a 10-km-diameter impactor would lead to global warming (3.5 °C) caused by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration (+470 ppmv), interrupted by a succession of short-term cooling events, provided by a “shielding effect” due to the formation of sulfate aerosols. The consequences related to these climate changes were the decrease of the surface ocean pH by 0.2 (from 8.0 to 7.8), while the deep ocean pH dropped by 0.4 (from 7.8 to 7.4). Without requiring any additional perturbations, these environmental disturbances led to a drastic decrease of the biomass of calcifying species and their biodiversity by $\sim$80%, while the biodiversity of noncalcifying species was reduced by $\sim$60%. We also suggest that the short-lived acidification caused by the Chicxulub impact, when combined with eruption of the Deccan Traps, may explain the severity of the extinction among pelagic calcifying species.},

abstract = {Aim: Climate classification systems (CCSs) can be used to predict how species' distributions might be altered by climate change and to increase the reliability of these estimates is an important goal in biogeographical research. We produce an objective, global climate classification system (CCS) at high temporal resolution based on plant physiology as a robust way to predict how climate change may impact terrestrial biomes. Location: Global. Taxon: Plantae. Methods: We construct ten climate variables that capture the physiological processes that determine plant distributions and use cluster analysis to present a new global CCS which accounts for variation in these aspects of climate. We use Kappa statistics to compare the distribution of climate zones in a five- and six-cluster CCS constructed using the physiology variables to the popular K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger and K{\"{o}}ppen-Trewartha CCSs, respectively, and find good correlation in both cases. Results: Our CCS highlights ten climate zones for plants. We show that clustering of the physiologically relevant variables reproduces known, present-day patterns of vegetation but also indicates important areas where zone assignment in our physiological CCSs is different to that of the K{\"{o}}ppen systems. Main conclusions: The existing K{\"{o}}ppen CCSs do not entirely reflect the physiological processes that determine plant distributions. Predictions of climate-driven changes in plant distributions may thus be unreliable in areas where zone assignment by clustering of physiologically relevant variables is different to that of the K{\"{o}}ppen systems. Both the physiological relevance and temporal resolution of climate variables used to construct CCSs should be considered in order to predict reliably how climate change may alter plant distributions and to support an appropriate global response to conserve plant biodiversity for the future.},

abstract = {We herein present the CLIMBER-3$\alpha$ Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC), which has evolved from the CLIMBER-2 EMIC. The main difference with respect to CLIMBER-2 is its oceanic component, which has been replaced by a state-of-the-art ocean model, which includes an ocean general circulation model (GCM), a biogeochemistry module, and a state-of-the-art sea-ice model. Thus, CLIMBER-3$\alpha$ includes modules describing the atmosphere, land-surface scheme, terrestrial vegetation, ocean, sea ice, and ocean biogeochemistry. Owing to its relatively simple atmospheric component, it is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than coupled GCMs, allowing the performance of a much larger number of integrations and sensitivity studies as well as longer ones. At the same time its oceanic component confers on it a larger degree of realism compared to those EMICs which include simpler oceanic components. The coupling does not include heat or freshwater flux corrections. The comparison against the climatologies shows that CLIMBER-3$\alpha$ satisfactorily describes the large-scale characteristics of the atmosphere, ocean and sea ice on seasonal timescales. As a result of the tracer advection scheme employed, the ocean component satisfactorily simulates the large-scale oceanic circulation with very little numerical and explicit vertical diffusion. The model is thus suited for the study of the large-scale climate and large-scale ocean dynamics. We herein describe its performance for present-day boundary conditions. In a companion paper (Part II), the sensitivity of the model to variations in the external forcing, as well as the role of certain model parameterisations and internal parameters, will be analysed. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

On the geologic timescale, pO2) is regulated by the burial of organic carbon and sulphur, as well as by weathering3. Reconstructions of atmospheric O2 for the past 400 million years have therefore been based on geochemical models of carbon and sulphur cycling4-6. However, these reconstructions vary widely4-10, particularly for the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic eras. Here we show that the abundance of charcoal in mire settings is controlled by pO2, and use this proxy to reconstruct the concentration of atmospheric oxygen for the past 400 million years. We estimate that pO2 was continuously above 26% during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, and that it declined abruptly around the time of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. During the Triassic and Jurassic periods, pO2 fluctuated cyclically, with amplitudes up to 10% and a frequency of 20-30 million years. Atmospheric oxygen concentrations have declined steadily from the middle of the Cretaceous period to present-day values of about 21%. We conclude, however, that variation in pO2 was not the main driver of the loss of faunal diversity during the Permo-Triassic and Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction events. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) simulated by 10 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) for the historical (1850-2005) and future climate is examined. The historical simulations of the AMOC mean state are more closely matched to observations than those of phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3). Similarly to CMIP3, all models predict a weakening of the AMOC in the twenty-first century, though the degree of weakening varies considerably among the models. Under the representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario, the weakening by year 2100 is 5%-40% of the individual model's historical mean state; under RCP8.5, the weakening increases to 15%-60% over the same period. RCP4.5 leads to the stabilization of the AMOC in the second half of the twenty-first century and a slower (then weakening rate) but steady recovery thereafter, while RCP8.5 gives rise to a continuous weakening of the AMOC throughout the twenty-first century. In the CMIP5 historical simulations, all but one model exhibit a weak downward trend [ranging from 20.1 to 21.8 Sverdrup (Sv) century-1; 1Sv ≡ 106m3M s-1] over the twentieth century. Additionally, the multimodel ensemble- mean AMOC exhibits multidecadal variability with a ;60-yr periodicity and a peak-to-peak amplitude of ;1 Sv; all individual models project consistently onto this multidecadal mode. This multidecadal variability is significantly correlated with similar variations in the net surface shortwave radiative flux in the North Atlantic and with surface freshwater flux variations in the subpolar latitudes. Potential drivers for the twentieth-century multimodel AMOC variability, including external climate forcing and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the implication of these results on the North Atlantic SST variability are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

However, details of the pattern of redox heterogeneity and its underlying causes remain unclear. Here, we present a high-resolution geochemical study of a drillcore section (Pengye #1) from Pengshui County (Chongqing municipality, southwestern China) that was located in the semi-restricted inner Yangtze Sea during the OST. We analyzed Fe-speciation, redox-sensitive trace elements, major elements, and pyrite $\delta$34S compositions ($\delta$34Spy) and then compared these data with published results from coeval sections at Datianba and Shuanghe in the same basin. The integrated dataset demonstrates pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity of redox conditions—especially the local development of euxinic conditions in the inner Yangtze Sea during the OST. Integrated data further suggest that high primary productivity and ample Fe fluxes in the inner Yangtze Sea may have depleted dissolved sulfate through microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) and subsequent pyrite formation, except in areas with enhanced sulfate supply from continental weathering or open-ocean exchange, which varied as a function of both tectonic (i.e., the regional Kwangsian Orogeny) and eustatic changes (i.e., the global Hirnantian glaciation). Limited sulfate availability thus likely prevented the development of euxinic conditions in some regions of the inner Yangtze Sea, as reflected in spatial variation of $\delta$34Spy. Our study highlights the potential role of sulfate availability on the development of watermass euxinia in semi-restricted marginal-marine basins during the OST.},

Epeiric seas are warmer and more seasonal than open-ocean values from the same latitudes, while continental margins exhibit consistent and predictable deviations related to gyre circulation. Warm temperatures inferred from Paleozoic proxy data may largely reflect that these data derive almost entirely from epeiric seas. Moreover, pseudoproxy analysis using Paleogene sampling localities demonstrates how undersampling of the full range of dynamical environments associated with gyre circulation can generate spurious estimates of latitudinal temperature gradients. Recognition of these global patterns permits a predictive framework within which to more robustly interpret proxy data, improve Earth system models, and reconstruct ancient dynamic regimes.},

abstract = {Climatically-related sedimentary facies and faunal distributions have been combined with palaeomagnetic data to make provisional reconstructions of the early Cambrian world. Laurentia, Baltica and Siberia appear to have formed a continental group which rifted apart from each other prior to 600 Ma. The consolidation of much of Gondwana probably occurred (in the Pan-African orogeny) well before the Cambrian, though the asssembly of several east Asian terranes is still speculative. The archaeocyathan reefs of Siberia, southern Europe and Morocco, with their bigotinid trilobite fauna, suggest that these areas were adjacent to each other and at low latitudes. Avalonia had close faunal links with western Gondwana, but lacked bigotinids and archaeocyathans and may have been situated off west Africa and Florida. During the early Cambrian, there was a northward migration of Laurentia towards the Equator as its separation from Baltica and Siberia increased, and a southward movement of Gondwana. -Authors},

Here we study the state dependence of ECS over a large range of global mean surface temperature (GMST) in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) Versions 4, 5, and 6 by varying atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find a robust increase of ECS with GMST in all three models, albeit at different rates, which is primarily attributed to strengthening of the shortwave cloud feedback (?cld) at both high and low latitudes. Over high latitudes, increasing GMST leads to a reduction in the cloud ice fraction, weakening the (negative) cloud-phase feedback due to the phase transition of cloud ice to liquid and thereby strengthening ?cld. Over low-latitude regions, increasing GMST strengthens ?cld likely through the nonlinear increase in water vapor, which causes low-cloud thinning through thermodynamic and radiative processes.},

abstract = {Although the responses of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is deeply connected to orbital rhythms, those under different tectonic and atmospheric boundary conditions remain unknown. Here, we report suborbitally resolved benthic foraminiferal stable isotope data from J-anomaly Ridge in the North Atlantic from ca. 26.4–26.0 Ma. Our results indicate that the formation of NADW during that time interval was increased during the obliquity-paced interglacial periods, similar to in the Plio-Pleistocene. During the late Oligocene, the interglacial poleward shifts of the stronger westerlies in the southern hemisphere, which occurred due to the higher thermal contrasts near the upper limit of the troposphere, reinforced the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and, in turn, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). However, such a response mode in deep ocean circulation did not occur during the middle Eocene because of different tectonic boundary conditions and the immature states of the ACC. Instead, the middle Eocene interglacial conditions weakened the formation of the proto-type NADW due to less heat loss rate in high-latitude regions of the North Atlantic during high obliquity periods. Our findings highlight the different responses of deep ocean circulation to orbital forcing and show that climate feedbacks can be largely sensitive to boundary conditions.},

In particular, modelling studies suggest that in order to achieve the global warmth that characterised the early Eocene, warmer climates must be more sensitive to CO2 forcing than colder climates. Here, we test this assertion in the geological record by combining a new high-resolution boron isotope-based CO2 record with novel estimates of Global Mean Temperature. We find that Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) was indeed higher during the warmest intervals of the Eocene, agreeing well with recent model simulations, and declined through the Eocene as global climate cooled. These observations indicate that the canonical IPCC range of ECS (1.5 to 4.5 °C per doubling) is unlikely to be appropriate for high-CO2 warm climates of the past, and the state dependency of ECS may play an increasingly important role in determining the state of future climate as the Earth continues to warm.},

Here we quantify high-resolution changes in species body size in major metazoan groups on the Siberian Platform during the early Cambrian (ca. 540–510 Million years ago (Ma)). Archaeocyath sponges, hyolith lophophorates, and helcionelloid mollusc species show dynamic and synchronous trends over million-year timescales, with peaks in body size during the latest Tommotian/early Atbadanian and late Atdabanian/early Botoman, and notably small body sizes in the middle Atdabanian and after the Sinsk anoxic extinction event, starting ca. 513 Ma. These intervals of body size changes are also mirrored in individual species and correlate positively with increased rates of origination and broadly with total species diversity. Calcitic brachiopods (rhynchonelliformeans), however, show a general increase in body size following the increase in species diversity through this interval: phosphatic brachiopods (linguliformeans) show a body size decrease that negatively correlates with diversity. Both brachiopod groups show a rapid recovery at the Sinsk Event. The synchronous changes in these metrics in archaeocyath, hyoliths and helcionelloids suggest the operation of external drivers through the early Cambrian, such as episodic changes in oxygenation or productivity. But the trends shown by brachiopods suggests a differing physiological response. Together, these dynamics created both the distinct evolutionary record of metazoan groups during the Cambrian Explosion and determined the nature of its termination.},

abstract = {Severe climatic and environmental changes are far more prevalent in Earth history than major extinction events, and the relationship between environmental change and extinction severity has important implications for the outcome of the ongoing anthropogenic extinction event. The response of mineralized marine plankton to environmental change offers an interesting contrast to the overall record of marine biota, which is dominated by benthic invertebrates. Here, we summarize changes in the species diversity of planktic foraminifera and calcareous nannoplankton over the Mesozoic-Cenozoic and that of radiolarians and diatoms over the Cenozoic. We find that, aside from the Triassic-Jurassic and Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction events, extinction in the plankton is decoupled from that in the benthos. Extinction in the plankton appears to be driven primarily by majorclimatic shifts affecting water column stratification, temperature, and, perhaps, chemistry. Changes that strongly affect the benthos, such as acidification and anoxia, have little effect on the plankton or are associated with radiation. Fossilizing marine plankton provide some of the most highly temporally and taxonomically resolved records of biodiversity since the Mesozoic. The record of extinction and origination in the plankton differs from the overall marine biodiversity record in revealing ways. Changes to water column stratification and global circulation are the main drivers of plankton diversity. Anoxia, acidification, and eutrophication (which strongly influence total marine fossil diversity) are less important in the plankton.},

@article{Wu2010,
abstract = {This study examines the sulfur isotope record of seawater sulfate proxies using $\delta$34S and $\Delta$33S to place constraints on the average global fractionation ($\Delta$34Spy) associated with pyrite formation and burial and the exponent $\lambda$ that relates variations of the 34S/32S to variations of the 33S/32S. The results presented here use an analysis of the sulfur isotope record from seawater sulfate proxies and sedimentary sulfide to extract this quantity as the arithmetic difference between $\delta$34S of seawater sulfate and contemporaneous sulfide. It also uses an independent method that draws on inferences about the $\Delta$33S evolution of seawater sulfate to evaluate this further. These two methods yield similar results suggesting that $\Delta$34Spy and $\lambda$ changed over the course of the Phanerozoic from slightly lower values of $\Delta$34Spy (lower values of $\lambda$) in the early Phanerozoic (Cambrian-Permian) to higher values of $\Delta$34Spy (higher values of $\lambda$) starting in the Triassic. This change of $\Delta$34Spy and the exponent $\lambda$ is interpreted to reflect a change in the proportion of sulfide that was reoxidized and processed by bacterial disproportionation on a global scale. The revised record of $\Delta$34Spy also yields model pyrite burial curves making them more closely resemble model evolution curves for other element systems and global sea level curves. It is suggested that possible links to sea level may occur via changes in the area of submerged continental shelves which would provide additional loci for pyrite burial. The slightly different constraints used by the two approaches to calculate this fractionation may allow for additional information to be obtained about the sulfur cycle with future studies. For instance, the correspondence of these results suggests that the inferred variation of 34S/32S of pyrite is real, and that there is no significant missing sink of fractionated sulfur at the resolution of the present study (such as might be associated with organic sulfur). Burial of organic sulfur may, however, have been important at some times in the Phanerozoic and shorter timescale deviations between results provided by these methods may be observed with higher resolution sampling. If observed, this would suggest either that the record for pyrite (or less likely sulfate) is biased, or that another sink (possibly as organic sulfur) was important during these times in the Phanerozoic. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent work indicates a large increase in the tectonic CO2 degassing rate between the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic Eras.

abstract = {The evolution of the Northern Hemisphere oceanic gateways has facilitated ocean circulation changes and may have influenced climatic variations in the Cenozoic time (66 Ma–0 Ma). However, the timing of these oceanic gateway events is poorly constrained and is often neglected in global paleobathymetric reconstructions. We have therefore re-evaluated the evolution of the Northern hemisphere oceanic gateways (i.e. the Fram Strait, Greenland–Scotland Ridge, the Central American Seaway, and the Tethys Seaway) and embedded their tectonic histories in a new global paleobathymetry and topography model for the Cenozoic time. Our new paleobathymetry model incorporates Northeast Atlantic paleobathymetric variations due to Iceland mantle plume activity, updated regional plate kinematics, and models for the oceanic lithospheric age, sediment thickness, and reconstructed oceanic plateaus and microcontinents. We also provide a global paleotopography model based on new and previously published regional models. In particular, the new model documents important bathymetric changes in the Northeast Atlantic and in the Tethys Seaway near the Eocene–Oligocene transition ($\sim$34 Ma), the time of the first glaciations of Antarctica, believed to be triggered by the opening of the Southern Ocean gateways (i.e. the Drake Passage and the Tasman Gateway) and subsequent Antarctic Circumpolar Current initiation. Our new model can be used to test whether the Northern Hemisphere gateways could have also played an important role modulating ocean circulation and climate at that time. In addition, we provide a set of realistic global bathymetric and topographic reconstructions for the Cenozoic time at one million-year interval for further use in paleo-ocean circulation and climate models.},

abstract = {The history of oceanic oxygenation from the late Neoproterozoic to the early Cambrian is currently debated, making it difficult to gauge whether, and to what extent environmental triggers played a role in shaping the trajectory of metazoan diversification. Uranium isotope ($\delta$238U) records from carbonates have recently been used to argue for significant swings in the global marine redox state from the late Neoproterozoic to the early Cambrian. However, geochemical signatures in carbonates—the U isotope archive most commonly employed to argue for redox shifts—are susceptible to diagenetic alteration and may have variable offsets from seawater values. Therefore, there is an impetus to reconstruct seawater U isotopic evolution using another sedimentary archive, in order to verify that these excursions can indeed be linked to global shifts in marine redox landscape. Here we report new U isotope data from two fine-grained siliciclastic upper Ediacaran to lower Cambrian (ca. 551–515 Ma) successions in South China. We find large $\delta$238U swings between −0.63‰ and +0.39‰ for calculated values of authigenic U in the siliciclastic rocks, consistent with correlative records from the carbonates. The replication of these patterns in both carbonate and siliciclastic units provides confirmatory evidence that the early Cambrian seawater was characterized by highly variable U isotope compositions. These new $\delta$238U data also provide higher-resolution records of global oceanic redox conditions during Cambrian Age 3, coeval with a critical interval of the Cambrian explosion. These $\delta$238U data bolster the case that the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition experienced massive swings in marine redox state, providing a dynamic environmental backdrop for and potentially even a key driver of the emergence and radiation of metazoans.},

abstract = {Several Late Devonian sedimentary successions host pyrite with highly positive sulfur isotope values ($\delta$34Spyrite). These anomalous values have been linked to marine anoxia, low sulfate concentrations in seawater, or aerobic re-oxidation of dissolved sulfide within well-oxygenated bottom waters in a local depositional environment. Implicit to these previous models is the assumption of a biogenic genesis from microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) of these pyrites, which, in turn, can be used to understand the biogeochemical sulfur cycle and reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions. In South China, the Late-Devonian bulk-rock sulfur isotope excursion occurs in the lower Fammenian Wuzhishan Formation of the Youjiang Basin, in both the sedimentary limestone that corresponds to the Late triangularis conodont zone at the Fuhe section and the sediment-hosted Xialei Mn deposit that lies between the Late triangularis and crepida conodont zones. To further constrain the significance of these 34S-enriched pyrites, we carried out detailed textural and in-situ sulfur isotope examinations of pyrites in the Xialei Mn deposit. We found one type of pyrite in siliceous limestone referred to as the host rocks and three distinct pyrite types in Mn ores: Type I – pyrites with Mn-carbonate inclusion-rich cores; Type II – pyrite overgrowths surrounding an “inclusion-rich” core; and Type III – relatively inclusion-poor and mainly subhedral disseminated pyrite grains. Type I pyrites in Mn ores have negative $\delta$34Spyrite values from −7.8‰ to −2.0‰. Types II and III pyrites, and pyrites in the host rock are characterized by highly positive $\delta$34Spyrite values (+4.2‰ to +37.6‰), with some values being higher than that of contemporaneous seawater sulfate. Type I pyrites with negative $\delta$34S values likely formed via MSR in a closed porewater system, driven by increased sedimentation rates during a sea level lowstand. The other pyrites with highly positive $\delta$34S values appear to have formed during secondary hydrothermal alteration, with their sulfur sourced through thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) of sulfate from dissolved barites in the underlying Liujiang Formation. This implies that the positive $\delta$34S values of the Late Devonian pyrites from the Wuzhishan Formation represent a later alteration event caused by post-depositional hydrothermal fluids, and may lack a direct biogeochemical connection to the surface sulfur cycle. These results provide an important perspective on the origin of variability in sulfur isotope records and suggest the need for careful petrographic screening and micrometer-scale analysis of sedimentary units used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions.},

abstract = {Deciphering the role—if any—that free oxygen levels played in controlling the timing and tempo of the radiation of complex life is one of the most fundamental questions in Earth and life sciences. Accurately reconstructing Earth's redox history is an essential part of tackling this question. Over the past few decades, there has been a proliferation of research employing geochemical redox proxies in an effort to tell the story of Earth's oxygenation. However, many of these studies, even those considering the same geochemical proxy systems, have led to conflicting interpretations of the timing and intensity of oxygenation events. There are two potential explanations for conflicting redox reconstructions: (i) that free oxygen levels were incredibly dynamic in both time and space or (ii) that collectively, as a community—including the authors of this article—we have frequently studied rocks affected by secondary weathering and alteration (particularly secondary oxidation) while neglecting to address the impact of this alteration on the generated data. There are now multiple case studies that have documented previously overlooked secondary alteration, resolving some of the conflicting constrains regarding redox evolution. Here, an analysis of a large shale geochemistry database reveals significant differences in cerium (Ce) anomalies, a common palaeoredox proxy, between outcrop and drill core samples. This inconsistency provides support for the idea that geochemical data from altered samples are frequently published in the peer-reviewed literature. As individuals and a geochemical community, most of us have been slow to appreciate how pervasive the problem is but there are examples of other communities that have faced and met the challenges raised by such quality control crises. Further evidence of the high potential for alteration of deep-time geochemical samples, and recognition of the manner in which this may lead to spurious results and palaeoenvironmental interpretations, indicate that sample archiving, in publicly accessible collections needs to become a prerequisite for publication of new palaeoredox data. Finally, the geochemical community need to think about ways to implement additional quality control measures to increase the fidelity of palaeoredox proxy work.},

abstract = {Precambrian banded iron formations (BIF) are chemical sedimentary deposits whose trace element signatures have been widely used to interrogate the chemical composition and redox state of ancient seawater. Here we investigated trace element signatures in BIF of the 3.22 Ga Moodies Group, Barberton Greenstone Belt (South Africa), which are interbedded with near-shore siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and represent one of the oldest known shallow-water occurrences of BIF. Unusual rare earth element (REE) signatures, notably with pronounced negative Ce anomalies in shale-normalized spectra, have been previously reported for chemical sediments of the Moodies Group, which we confirm here through an expanded dataset for Moodies BIF spanning three different localities. We find negative Ce anomalies as low as 0.2 Ce/Ce⁎ that are associated with unusual enrichment of LREE relative to HREE in the sample set. While total REE abundances and certain REE features appear strongly related to the concentration of detrital indicators (e.g., Zr), and are likely primary, other features, notably LREE enrichment, cannot be explained as a primary feature of the sediment. This is better explained by later addition of REE from a LREE-enriched but Ce-depleted fluid that generated the significant negative Ce anomalies observed in surface samples of Moodies Group BIF. This REE addition event influenced both Sm-Nd and La-Ce isotope systematics, the latter yielding an isochron of 60 ± 32 Ma, thus constraining the timing of emplacement of the negative Ce anomalies to the past 100 Ma, possibly upon surface exposure of the Barberton Greenstone Belt to wetter conditions during the Cenozoic. Our findings constitute a cautionary tale in that even the most immobile elemental redox proxies may be more sensitive to post-depositional modification than previously thought, and demonstrate the clear advantage offered by paleoredox proxies coupled to radiometric geochronometers to enable the direct dating of ancient signals of Earth surface oxygenation.},

abstract = {Animals originated and evolved during a unique time in Earth history—the Neoproterozoic Era. This paper aims to discuss (1) when landmark events in early animal evolution occurred, and (2) the environmental context of these evolutionary milestones, and how such factors may have affected ecosystems and body plans. With respect to timing, molecular clock studies—utilizing a diversity of methodologies—agree that animal multicellularity had arisen by $\sim$800 million years ago (Ma) (Tonian period), the bilaterian body plan by $\sim$650 Ma (Cryogenian), and divergences between sister phyla occurred $\sim$560–540 Ma (late Ediacaran). Most purported Tonian and Cryogenian animal body fossils are unlikely to be correctly identified, but independent support for the presence of pre-Ediacaran animals is recorded by organic geochemical biomarkers produced by demosponges. This view of animal origins contrasts with data from the fossil record, and the taphonomic question of why animals were not preserved (if present) remains unresolved. Neoproterozoic environments demanding small, thin, body plans, and lower abundance/rarity in populations may have played a role. Considering environmental conditions, geochemical data suggest that animals evolved in a relatively low-oxygen ocean. Here, we present new analyses of sedimentary total organic carbon contents in shales suggesting that the Neoproterozoic ocean may also have had lower primary productivity—or at least lower quantities of organic carbon reaching the seafloor—compared with the Phanerozoic. Indeed, recent modeling efforts suggest that low primary productivity is an expected corollary of a low-O 2 world. Combined with an inability to inhabit productive regions in a low-O 2 ocean, earliest animal communities would likely have been more food limited than generally appreciated, impacting both ecosystem structure and organismal behavior. In light of this, we propose the “fire triangle” metaphor for environmental influences on early animal evolution. Moving toward consideration of all environmental aspects of the Cambrian radiation (fuel, heat, and oxidant) will ultimately lead to a more holistic view of the event.},

However, establishing such a linkage between oxygen and evolution for the later Cambrian 'explosion' (540-520 Ma) of new, energy-sapping body plans and behaviours has proved more elusive. Here we present new molybdenum isotope data, which demonstrate that the areal extent of oxygenated bottom waters increased in step with the early Cambrian bioradiation of animals and eukaryotic phytoplankton. Modern-like oxygen levels characterized the ocean at ∼521 Ma for the first time in Earth history. This marks the first establishment of a key environmental factor in modern-like ecosystems, where animals benefit from, and also contribute to, the 'homeostasis' of marine redox conditions.},

It was typified by a rapid rise in atmospheric CO2, global warming, and marine anoxia, leading to the widespread devastation of marine ecosystems. However, the precise timing and extent to which oceanic anoxic conditions expanded during OAE 2 remains unresolved. We present a record of global ocean redox changes during OAE 2 using a combined geochemical and carbon cycle modeling approach. We utilize a continuous, high-resolution record of uranium isotopes in pelagic and platform carbonate sediments to quantify the global extent of seafloor anoxia during OAE 2. This dataset is then compared with a dynamic model of the coupled global carbon, phosphorus, and uranium cycles to test hypotheses for OAE 2 initiation. This unique approach highlights an intra-OAE complexity that has previously been underconstrained, characterized by two expansions of anoxia separated by an episode of globally significant reoxygenation coincident with the "Plenus Cold Event." Each anoxic expansion event was likely driven by rapid atmospheric CO2 injections from multiphase Large Igneous Province activity.},

abstract = {The effect of variable vertical diffusivity is investigated in dynamically reduced models of the thermohaline circulation (THC) in a rectangular basin. In a simple box model, sufficiently strong variation of the diffusivity $\kappa$v with stability G can lead to the existence of two stable equilibria. Related behaviour is found in well-resolved frictional geostrophic (FG) models. A hierarchy of under-resolved FG models is constructed, the simplest of which is an 8-cell cube, to connect the two extremes of resolution. Multiple solutions in low-order models are found to correspond to the formation of high-gradient layers which are unlikely to be resolved by current ocean models. Physical arguments show that layering and multiple solutions require $\kappa$v to decrease more rapidly than 1/G and sensitivity experiments suggest that, in addition, $\kappa$v must vary by a factor of 10-100. In two-hemisphere runs with salinity forcing included, the dependence of diffusivity on stratification is found to marginally favour equatorially symmetric states. Finally, such variation is shown to have a profound effect on the periodic, flush-collapse cycle under strong saline forcing; specifically, if diffusivity is taken to be a function of stratification rather than depth, regime transitions can occur much more easily. It will therefore be important for climate modelling to determine which is more realistic. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {During the four most recent glacial maxima, atmospheric CO2 has been lowered by about 90-100 ppm with respect to interglacial concentrations. It is likely that most of the atmospheric CO2 deficit was stored in the ocean. Changes in the biological pump, which are related to the efficiency of the biological carbon uptake in the surface ocean and/or of the export of organic carbon to the deep ocean, have been proposed as a key mechanism for the increased glacial oceanic CO2 storage. The biological pump is strongly constrained by the amount of available surface nutrients. In models, it is generally assumed that the ratio between elemental nutrients, such as phosphorus, and carbon (C/P ratio) in organic material is fixed according to the classical Redfield ratio. The constant Redfield ratio appears to approximately hold when averaged over basin scales, but observations document highly variable C/P ratios on regional scales and between species. If the C/P ratio increases when phosphate availability is scarce, as observations suggest, this has the potential to further increase glacial oceanic CO2 storage in response to changes in surface nutrient distributions. In the present study, we perform a sensitivity study to test how a phosphate-concentration-dependent C/P ratio influences the oceanic CO2 storage in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (cGENIE). We carry out simulations of glacial-like changes in albedo, radiative forcing, wind-forced circulation, remineralization depth of organic matter, and mineral dust deposition. Specifically, we compare model versions with the classical constant Redfield ratio and an observationally motivated variable C/P ratio, in which the carbon uptake increases with decreasing phosphate concentration. While a flexible C/P ratio does not impact the model's ability to simulate benthic $\delta$13C patterns seen in observational data, our results indicate that, in production of organic matter, flexible C/P can further increase the oceanic storage of CO2 in glacial model simulations. Past and future changes in the C/P ratio thus have implications for correctly projecting changes in oceanic carbon storage in glacial-to-interglacial transitions as well as in the present context of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations.},

The organic paleothermometer TEX86 is one of the few proxies available for reconstructing quantitative estimates of upper ocean temperatures of this time period. Here we show that the sedimentary TEX86 signal in the Early Cretaceous North and South Atlantic shows systematic differences to other Cretaceous samples. In particular, the relative increase in the fractional abundances of the crenarchaeol isomer compared to crenarchaeol exhibits similarities with surface sediments from the modern Mediterranean and Red Sea. Dedicated climate model simulations suggest that the formation of warm and saline deep waters in the restricted North and South Atlantic may have influenced TEX86 export dynamics leading to a warm bias in reconstructed upper ocean temperatures. Applying a regional calibration from the modern Mediterranean and Red Sea to corresponding TEX86 data significantly improves the model-data fit for the Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a and the overall comparison with other temperature proxies for the Early Cretaceous. Our results demonstrate the need to consider regional and temporal changes of the TEX86-temperature relation for the reconstruction of deep-time ocean temperatures.},

The precursor of glendonite, ikaite (CaCO3 {\textperiodcentered} 6H2O), is metastable and has only been observed in nature at temperatures <7 °C. Therefore, glendonites in the sedimentary record are commonly used as paleotemperature indicators. However, several laboratory experiments have shown that the mineral can nucleate at temperatures>7 °C. Here we investigate the nucleation range for ikaite as a function of temperature and pH. We found that ikaite precipitated at temperatures of at least 35 °C at pH 9.3 −10.3 from a mixture of natural seawater and sodium carbonate rich solution. At pH 9.3, we observed pseudomorphic replacement of ikaite by porous calcite during the duration of the experiment (c. 5 hours). These results imply that ikaite can form at relatively high temperatures but will then be rapidly replaced by a calcite pseudomorph. This finding challenges the use of glendonites as paleotemperature indicators.},

Three diversity pulses characterized the northern Gondwanan margin through the studied interval; an initial increase in linguliformean diversity that culminated during the Tremadocian (Tr3); a second, Darriwilian (Dw2) pulse caused primarily by a rise in orthid species; and a third pulse during Katian times (Ka3–4) marking the most diverse and phylogenetically complex faunas recorded in this study. Each of the three diversity pulses is phylogenetically distinct and characterized by large turnover rates. The first pulse consists almost exclusively of remnants of the Cambrian Evolutionary Fauna, whereas the second pulse shows a sudden rise of clades typical of the Paleozoic Evolutionary Fauna. The fact that otherwise typical Cambrian clades also radiated at the dawn of the Ordovician suggests that whatever facilitated the emerging Ordovician Radiation, also benefitted these ancient lineages. However, eventually the succeeding Paleozoic Evolutionary Fauna came to dominate during the second diversity pulse. This pulse represents a high-latitude correlative to the main pulse of the Ordovician Radiation. Although it coincides with a globally occurring transgression of eustatic nature, our analysis shows that the generic composition remained overwhelmingly endemic up through the Darriwilian–Sandbian interval. Opposed to this, the third pulse coincides with the globally occurring Boda warming event, which also marks a time of global dispersal. In Iberia, this is reflected by almost entirely cosmopolitan brachiopod faunas, suggesting that the phases of rapid speciation which characterize the Ordovician Radiation had ceased by the mid-Katian.},

abstract = {Long-term variations in eustatic sea level in an ice-free world, which existed through most of the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic eras, are partly driven by changes in the volume of ocean basins. Previous studies have determined ocean basin volume changes from plate tectonic reconstructions since the Mesozoic; however, these studies have not considered a number of important elements that contribute to ocean basin volume, such as regional differences in sedimentation, or uncertainties within the plate tectonic model itself, such as spreading asymmetries and the incomplete representation of back-arc basins in the Mesozoic. Additionally, studies on long-term changes in sea level related to the extension and rifting of passive margins have not been performed on a global-scale and likely significantly underestimated the influence of this process. In order to improve reconstructions of sea level on geologic time scales and assess the uncertainty in deriving the volume of ocean basins based on a global plate kinematic model, we investigate the influence of back-arc basins, spreading asymmetry, large igneous provinces (LIPs), sediment thickness, and passive margins on ocean basin volume since 200 Ma. We find that less-constrained plate tectonic elements, such as the presence of back-arc basins or spreading asymmetry, may contribute up to $\sim$120 m or $\sim$150 m to sea level respectively. Changes in the sea level related to sedimentation and LIPs are respectively $\sim$75–165 m and $\sim$45 m. Changes in sea level associated with passive margin formation are almost negligible at present day, though were much larger in the Cretaceous, and the assumed sedimentation style strongly influences the rate and magnitude of sea-level change. We incorporate predictions for these components during times where ocean basins are predominantly synthetic reconstructions and find that sea level driven by fluctuating ocean basin volume has changed by $\sim$200 m since the Jurassic, which is comparable to previous estimates. Our revised estimates will need to be combined with other processes driving long-term sea-level change, including mantle convection-driven dynamic topography and glacio-eustasy for constructing a complete eustatic sea-level curve. Understanding and quantifying the uncertainties in the volume of ocean basins has implications for modelling subduction flux, the oceanic carbon cycle, and heatflow, and is important for exploring Earth's evolutionary cycles, especially during times in the geologic past where much of the ocean basin history has been lost.},

abstract = {The distance travelled by marine larvae varies by seven orders of magnitude. Dispersal shapes marine biodiversity, and must be understood if marine systems are to be well managed. Because warmer temperatures quicken larval development, larval durations might be systematically shorter in the tropics relative to those at high latitudes. Nevertheless, life history and hydrodynamics also covary with latitude—these also affect dispersal, precluding any clear expectation of how dispersal changes at a global scale. Here we combine data from the literature encompassing >750 marine organisms from seven phyla with oceanographic data on current speeds, to quantify the overall latitudinal gradient in larval dispersal distance. We find that planktonic duration increased with latitude, confirming predictions that temperature effects outweigh all others across global scales. However, while tropical species have the shortest planktonic durations, realized dispersal distances were predicted to be greatest in the tropics and at high latitudes, and lowest at mid-latitudes. At high latitudes, greater dispersal distances were driven by moderate current speed and longer planktonic durations. In the tropics, fast currents overwhelmed the effect of short planktonic durations. Our results contradict previous hypotheses based on biology or physics alone; rather, biology and physics together shape marine dispersal patterns.},

abstract = {Geologic deposits containing fossils with remains of non-biomineralized tissues (i.e. Konservat-Lagerst{\"{a}}tten) provide key insights into ancient organisms and ecosystems. Such deposits are not evenly distributed through geologic time or space, suggesting that global phenomena play a key role in exceptional fossil preservation. Nonetheless, establishing the influence of global phenomena requires documenting temporal and spatial trends in occurrences of exceptionally preserved fossil assemblages. To this end, we compiled and analyzed a dataset of 694 globally distributed exceptional fossil assemblages spanning the history of complex eukaryotic life ($\sim$ 610 to 3 Ma). Our analyses demonstrate that assemblages with similar ages and depositional settings commonly occur in clusters, each signifying an ancient geographic region (up to hundreds of kilometers in scale), which repeatedly developed conditions conducive to soft tissue preservation. Using a novel hierarchical clustering approach, we show that these clusters decrease in number and shift from open marine to transitional and non-marine settings across the Cambrian-Ordovician interval. Conditions conducive to exceptional preservation declined worldwide during the early Paleozoic in response to transformations of near-surface environments that promoted degradation of tissues and curbed authigenic mineralization potential. We propose a holistic explanation relating these environmental transitions to ocean oxygenation and bioturbation, which affected virtually all taphonomic pathways, in addition to changes in seawater chemistry that disproportionately affected processes of soft tissue conservation. After these transitions, exceptional preservation rarely occurred in open marine settings, excepting times of widespread oceanic anoxia, when low oxygen levels set the stage. With these patterns, non-marine cluster count is correlated with non-marine rock quantity, and generally decreases with age. This result suggests that geologic processes, which progressively destroy terrestrial rocks over time, limit sampling of non-marine deposits on a global scale. Future efforts should aim to assess the impacts of such phenomena on evolutionary and ecological patterns in the fossil record.},

abstract = {The role of the palaeogeography on the geological evolution of the global carbon cycle has been suspected since the development of the first global geochemical models in the early 80s. The palaeogeography has been rapidly recognized as a key factor controlling the long-term evolution of the atmospheric CO2 through its capability of modulating the efficiency of the silicate weathering. First the role of the latitudinal position of the continents has been emphasized: an averaged low latitudinal position promotes the CO2 consumption by silicate weathering, and is theoretically associated to low CO2 periods. With the increase of model complexity and the explicit consideration of the hydrological cycle, the importance of the continentality factor has been recognized: periods of supercontinent assembly coincide with high pCO2 values due to the development of arid conditions which weaken the silicate weathering efficiency. These fundamental feedbacks between climate, carbon cycle and tectonic have been discovered by pioneer modelling studies and opened new views in the understanding of the history of Earth's climate. Today, some of the key features of the Phanerozoic climate can be explained by: (1) continental drift; (2) small continental blocks moving to tropical belts; and (3) modulation of the climate sensitivity to CO2 by palaeogeography changes. Those results emphasize the need for a careful process-based modelling of the water cycle and climate response to the continental drift. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

The meaning of these rules, in terms of model calibration, validation and extrapolation, is analysed. They impose very strong limitations on the applicability of such models.

@article{Canfield1998,
abstract = {There was a significant oxidation of the Earth's surface around 2 billion years ago (2 Gyr). Direct evidence for this oxidation comes, mostly, from geological records of the redox-sensitive elements Fe and U reflecting the conditions prevailing during weathering. The oxidation event was probably driven by an increased input of oxygen to the atmosphere arising from an increased sedimentary burial of organic matter between 2.3 and 2.0 Gyr. This episode was postdated by the final large precipitation of banded iron formations around 1.8 Gyr. It is generally believed that banded iron formations precipitated from an ocean whose bottom waters contained significant concentrations of dissolved ferrous iron, and that this sedimentation process terminated when aerobic bottom waters developed, oxidizing the iron and thus removing it from solution. In contrast, I argue here that anoxic bottom waters probably persisted until well after the deposition of banded iron formations ceased; I also propose that sulphide, rather than oxygen, was responsible for removing iron from deep ocean water. The sulphur-isotope record supports this hypothesis as it indicates increasing concentrations of oceanic sulphate, starting around 2.3 Gyr, leading to increasing rates of sulphide production by sulphate reduction. The increase in sulphide production became sufficient, around 1.8 Gyr, to precipitate the total flux of iron into the oceans. I suggest that aerobic deep-ocean waters did not develop until the Neoproterozoic era (1.0 to $\sim$0.54 Gyr), in association with a second large oxidation of the Earth's surface. This new model is consistent with the emerging view of Precambrian sulphur geochemistry and the chemical events leading to the evolution of animals, and it is fully testable by detailed geochemical analyses of preserved deep- water marine sediments.},

Ecological triggers focused on escalatory predator-prey "arms races" can explain the evolutionary pattern but not its timing, whereas environmental triggers, particularly ocean/atmosphere oxygenation, do the reverse. Using modern oxygen minimum zones as an analog for Proterozoic oceans, we explore the effect of low oxygen levels on the feeding ecology of polychaetes, the dominant macrofaunal animals in deep-sea sediments. Here we show that low oxygen is clearly linked to low proportions of carnivores in a community and low diversity of carnivorous taxa, whereas higher oxygen levels support more complex food webs. The recognition of a physiological control on carnivory therefore links environmental triggers and ecological drivers, providing an integrated explanation for both the pattern and timing of Cambrian animal radiation.},

abstract = {The intensity and extent of anoxia during the two Kellwasser anoxic events has been investigated in a range of European localities using a multidisciplinary approach (pyrite framboid assay, gamma-ray spectrometry and sediment fabric analysis). The results reveal that the development of the Lower Kellwasser Horizon in the early Late rhenana Zone (Frasnian Stage) in German type sections does not always coincide with anoxic events elsewhere in Europe and, in some locations, seafloor oxygenation improves during this interval. Thus, this anoxic event is not universally developed. In contrast, the Upper Kellwasser Horizon, developed in the Late linguiformis Zone (Frasnian Stage) in Germany correlates with a European-wide anoxic event that is manifest as an intensification of anoxia in basinal locations to the point that stable euxinic conditions were developed (for example, in the basins of the Hoy Cross Mountains, Poland). The interval also saw the spread of dysoxic waters into very shallow water (for instance, reefal) locations, and it seems reasonable to link the contemporaneous demise of many marine taxa to this phase of intense and widespread anoxia. In basinal locations, euxinic conditions persisted into the earliest Famennian with little change of depositional conditions. Only in the continental margin location of Austria was anoxia not developed at any time in the Late Devonian. Consequently it appears that the Upper Kellwasser anoxic event was an epicontinental seaway phenomenon, caused by the upward expansion of anoxia from deep basinal locales rather than an 'oceanic' anoxic event that has spilled laterally into epicontinental settings. {\textcopyright} 2004 Cambridge University Press.},

Here, we analyze simulations of the early Eocene performed with the IPSL-2 CM5A2 coupled climate model set up with paleogeographic reconstructions of this period from the DeepMIP project, 3 with different levels of atmospheric CO2, and compare them with simulations of the modern conditions. This allows 4 us to explore the changes of the ocean circulation and the resulting ocean meridional heat transport. At a CO2 level of 5 840 ppm, the Early Eocene simulation is characterized by a strong abyssal overturning circulation in the Southern 6 Hemisphere (40 Sv at 60{\textordmasculine}S), fed by deep water formation in the three sectors of the Southern Ocean. Deep convection 7 in the Southern Ocean is favored by the closed Drake and Tasmanian passages, which provide western boundaries for 8 the build-up of strong subpolar gyres in the Weddell and Ross seas, in the middle of which convection develops. The 9 strong overturning circulation, associated with the subpolar gyres, sustains the poleward advection of saline 10 subtropical water to the convective region in the Southern Ocean, maintaining deep-water formation. This salt-11 advection feedback mechanism works similarly in the present-day North Atlantic overturning circulation. The strong 12 abyssal overturning circulation in the 55 Ma simulations primarily results in an enhanced poleward ocean heat 13 transport by 0.3-0.7 PW in the Southern Hemisphere compared to modern conditions, reaching 1.7 PW southward at 14 20°S, and contributing to maintain the Southern Ocean and Antarctica warm in the Eocene. Simulations with different 15 atmospheric CO2 levels show that the ocean circulation and heat transport are relatively insensitive to CO2-doubling. 16},

abstract = {Concurrent gaps in the Late Devonian/Mississippian fossil records of insects and tetrapods (i.e. Romer's Gap) have been attributed to physiological suppression by low atmospheric pO2. Here, updated stable isotope inputs inform a reconstruction of Phanerozoic oxygen levels that contradicts the low oxygen hypothesis (and contradicts the purported role of oxygen in the evolution of gigantic insects during the late Palaeozoic), but reconciles isotope- based calculations with other proxies, like charcoal. Furthermore, statistical analysis demonstrates that the gap between the first Devonian insect and earliest diverse insect assemblages of the Pennsylvanian (Bashkirian Stage) requires no special explanation if insects were neither diverse nor abundant prior to the evolution of wings. Rather than tracking physiological constraint, the fossil record may accurately record the transformative evolutionary impact of insect flight.},

abstract = {Based on the previous CMIP5-generation IPSL earth system model, we designed a new version, IPSL-CM5A2, aiming at running multi-millennial simulations typical of deep-time paleoclimates studies. Three priorities were followed during the setup of the model: (1) improving the overall model computing performance, (2) overcoming a persistent cold bias depicted in the previous model generation, and (3) making the model able to handle the specific continental configurations of the geological past. Technical developments have been performed on separate components and on the coupling system to 5 speed up the whole coupled model. These developments include the integration of hybrid parallelization MPI-OpenMP in LMDz atmospheric component, the use of a new library to perform parallel asynchronous input/output by using computing cores as "IO servers", the use of a parallel coupling library between the ocean and the atmospheric components. The model can now simulate ∼100 years per day, opening new possibilities towards the production of multi-millennial simulations with a full earth system model. The tuning strategy employed to overcome a persistent cold bias is detailed. The confrontation 10 of an historical simulation to climatological observations shows overall improved ocean meridional overturning circulation, marine productivity and latitudinal position of zonal wind patterns. We also present the numerous steps required to run the IPSL-CM5A2 for deep-time paleoclimates through a preliminary case-study for the Cretaceous. Namely, a specific work on the ocean model grid was required to run the model for specific continental configurations in which continents are relocated 1 according to past paleogeographic reconstructions. By briefly discussing the spin-up of such a simulation, we elaborate on the 15 requirements and challenges awaiting paleoclimate modelling in the next years, namely finding the best trade-off between the level of description of the processes and the computing cost on supercomputers.},

abstract = {Numerous negative carbon isotope excursions (nCIEs) in the geologic record occurring over 104-105 years are interpreted as episodes of massive carbon release. nCIEs help to illuminate the connection between past carbon cycling and climate variability. Theoretically, the size of a nCIE can be used to determine the mass of carbon released, provided that the carbon source is known or other environmental changes such as temperature or ocean pH can be constrained. A simple isotopic mass balance equation often serves as a first order estimate for the mass of carbon input, but this approach ignores the effects of negative carbon cycle-climate feedbacks. Here we show, using 432 earth system model simulations, that the mass of carbon release and associated environmental impacts for a nCIE of a given size and carbon source depend on the onset duration of that nCIE: the longer the nCIE onset duration, the greater the required carbon input in order to counterbalance the input of 13C-enriched carbon through carbonate compensation and weathering feedbacks. On timescales >103 years, these feedbacks remove carbon from the atmosphere so that the relative rise in atmospheric CO2 decreases with the nCIE onset duration. Consequently, the impacts on global temperature, surface ocean pH and saturation state are reduced if the nCIE has a long onset duration. The framework provided here demonstrates how constraints on the total nCIE duration and relative shape - together determining the onset duration - affect the interpretation of sedimentary nCIEs. Finally, we evaluate selected well-studied nCIEs, including the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (∼54 Ma), the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (∼56 Ma), and the Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event (∼120 Ma), in the context of our model-based framework and show how modeled environmental changes can be used to narrow down the most likely carbon emissions scenarios.},

Here we use the rare earth element patterns in marine carbonates to monitor the structure of the marine redox landscape through the rise and diversification of animals and early land plants. In particular, we use the relative abundance of cerium (Ceanom), the only redox-sensitive rare earth element, in well-preserved marine cements and other marine precipitates to track seawater oxygen levels. Our results indicate that there was only a moderate increase in oceanic oxygenation during the Ediacaran (average Cryogenian Ceanom = 1.1, average Ediacaran Ceanom = 0.62), followed by a decrease in oxygen levels during the early Cambrian (average Cryogenian Ceanom = 0.90), with significant ocean anoxia persisting through the early and mid Paleozoic (average Early Cambrian–Early Devonian Ceanom = 0.84). It was not until the Late Devonian that oxygenation levels are comparable to the modern (average of all post-middle Devonian Ceanom = 0.55). Therefore, this work confirms growing evidence that the oxygenation of the Earth was neither unidirectional nor a simple two-stage process. Further, we provide evidence that it was not until the Late Devonian, when large land plants and forests first evolved, that oxygen levels reached those comparable to the modern world. This is recorded with the first modern-like negative Ceanom (values <0.6) occurring at around 380 Ma (Frasnian).

abstract = {The Lower and Upper Kellwasser horizons represent two anoxic events that mark the mass extinction at the Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) boundary. Among other groups, conodont animals were severely affected, but the genus Palmatolepis survived with a complete turnover at the F-F boundary. Here the fine morphological variations of the genus Palmatolepis and the sea-surface temperature evolution are quantified in two F-F boundary sections using morphometrics and oxygen isotopic composition of apatite, respectively. In accordance with other F-F sections, the isotope records show two positive excursions of ∼1‰ during the Lower and Upper Kellwasser anoxic events. The conodont shape and the oxygen isotopic composition of the genus Palmatolepis are significantly correlated within the Frasnian and Famennian Stages, suggesting a strong environmental influence on the morphology of the feeding apparatus of the conodont animal. We propose that the morphological differences are linked to changes in the trophic position of Palmatolepis: enhanced organic carbon burial, which is supported by global positive carbon isotope excursions in inorganic and organic carbon during both the Lower and Upper Kellwasser events altered the primary biomass production and thus, the subsequent nutrient supply to higher trophic levels. While the carbon and oxygen isotopic shifts are of similar amplitude during Lower and Upper Kellwasser events, the variation of the shape of Palmatolepis during the Upper Kellwasser, i.e., the F-F boundary, is more pronounced than during the Lower Kellwasser. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction (EPME) profoundly shaped shallow marine ecosystems. Although much has been learned about this event based on the body-fossil record, the global infaunal response to the EPME, as represented by ichnofossils, is much less understood. Here we analyze secular changes in ichnodiversity and ichnodisparity from the late Permian to the Middle Triassic based on a global trace-fossil data set. Results show that, in contrast to the body-fossil record, late Permian global ichnodiversity and ichnodisparity maintained their level until the Griesbachian, followed by a sharp loss in the Dienerian. Notably, the Griesbachian shows an unusual dominance of shallower tiers. The discrepancy between the body- and trace-fossil record is interpreted to be the result of the resurgence of widespread microbial matgrounds in the Griesbachian that aided the preservation of surface, semi-infaunal, and shallow-tier ichnofossils. Our study shows that the EPME strongly affected the sediment mixed layer, allowing the preservation of shallower tier trace fossils. The disappearance of the mixed layer in the earliest Triassic may have enhanced pyrite burial in sediments and inhibited its further re-oxidation, therefore impacting sea water sulfate concentrations.},

abstract = {A ‘Neoproterozoic oxygenation event' is widely invoked as a causal factor in animal evolution, and often attributed to abiotic causes such as post-glacial pulses of phosphorus weathering. However, recent evidence suggests a series of transient ocean oxygenation events ∼660–520 Ma, which do not fit the simple model of a monotonic rise in atmospheric oxygen (pO2). Hence, we consider mechanisms by which the evolution of marine eukaryotes, coupled with biogeochemical and ecological feedbacks, potentially between alternate stable states, could have caused changes in ocean carbon cycling and redox state, phosphorus cycling and atmospheric pO2. We argue that the late Tonian ocean ∼750 Ma was dominated by rapid microbial cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with elevated nutrient (P) levels due to inefficient removal of organic matter to sediments. We suggest the abrupt onset of the eukaryotic algal biomarker record ∼660–640 Ma was linked to an escalation of protozoan predation, which created a ‘biological pump' of sinking particulate organic matter (POM). The resultant transfer of organic carbon (Corg) and phosphorus to sediments was strengthened by subsequent eukaryotic innovations, including the advent of sessile benthic animals and mobile burrowing animals. Thus, each phase of eukaryote evolution tended to lower P levels and oxygenate the ocean on ∼104 year timescales, but by decreasing Corg/P burial ratios, tended to lower atmospheric pO2 and deoxygenate the ocean again on ∼106 year timescales. This can help explain the transient nature and ∼106 year duration of oceanic oxygenation events through the Cryogenian–Ediacaran–Cambrian.},

abstract = {Oceanic environments and biotas were in a state of near-continuous perturbation during the Early Triassic, the $\sim$5-million-year interval following the latest Permian mass extinction (LPME), but the underlying cause(s) remain uncertain. The role of episodic volcanic or intrusive magmatic activity in triggering global-scale perturbations during this interval is suspected but has not been strongly evidenced to date. Here, we investigate the record of volcanism through the Early Triassic (with a focus on the Smithian-Spathian Boundary, or SSB) using mercury (Hg) concentrations in marine sediments as a proxy. This study examines five marine sections from three paleo-oceans (Paleo-Tethys, Neo-Tethys, and Panthalassa) representing a range of depositional settings from shallow platform to deep slope. Our results suggest that volcanic and magmatic activity of the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province (STLIP) was most intense during the first $\sim$1.3 million years following the LPME, and that termination of its most active stage was responsible for a sharp cooling event at the SSB. Variations in the intensity of STLIP activity are thus likely to account for the large (>8‰) fluctuations of $\delta$13Ccarb and related changes in oceanic redox and environmental conditions that characterized the Griesbachian to Smithian substages of the Early Triassic in marine sections globally. We hypothesize that a strong reduction or cessation of STLIP activity at the SSB set the stage for the recovery of marine biodiversity and ecosystems in the Spathian and later.},

abstract = {Sea-level change is an important parameter controlling the expansion of oxygen-depleted conditions in neritic settings during oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). Despite this fundamental role, it remains on a short timescale (<1 Myr) one of the least constrained parameters for numerous OAEs. Here we present sedimentological and geochemical evidence from Morocco and East Greenland showing that a forced regression shortly precedes (ca.102 kyr) the major transgression associated with the Toarcian OAE. The forced regression can be correlated over distances greater than 3000 km in numerous Tethyan and Boreal basins, indicating that the relative sea-level change was driven by eustastic fluctuations. The major amplitude (>50 m) and short duration of the forced regression suggests that it was most likely related to the transient waxing and waning of polar ice sheet. We suggest that this short-lived glaciation might have a genetic link with the inception of the Toarcian OAE. Indeed, during the deglaciation and the accompanying sea-level rise, the thawing permafrost may have released important quantities of methane into the atmosphere that would have contributed to the Toarcian OAE rapid warming and its characteristic negative carbon isotope excursion. This study offers a hypothesis on how some hyperthermal events might be rooted in short-lived “cold-snap” episodes.},

abstract = {This study determined chemical species of iron (Fe) and molybdenum (Mo) in a pelagic deep-sea Permian–Triassic boundary section, that records redox variations across the severe mass extinction event. We applied X-ray diffraction (XRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) at the Fe K-edge and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) at the Mo K-edge to silicic sedimentary rock samples for analysis of the studied section. According to the EXAFS and XRD analyses, pyrite was the dominant Fe-bearing mineral in most samples, whereas ferric minerals such as hematite were absent throughout the Permian–Triassic transition. This result supports those of previous studies of other deep-sea Japanese Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) sections. The Fe in pyrite mineral quantified by EXAFS spectra displayed synchronous variation with sulphide-sulphur (S sulphide ) but with total organic carbon content, which revealed the Fe-limited conditions for pyrite formation in the pelagic Panthalassa region. The XANES analysis indicated the presence of tetrahedral and octahedral configurations of Mo bonded to oxygen (O) and sulphur (S), which were referred to as MoO 42− , MoO 3 (as a possible alternative reference material of Mo in organic ligands), MoO 2 and MoS 2 . The MoS 2 species dominated in the end-Permian horizons, coinciding with high abundances of total Mo, which suggests a sulphidic depositional environment. The MoS 2 and MoO 3 species were the main contributors to these high Mo abundances in the end-Permian strata. The presence of the molybdenite (MoS 2 ) species in the studied section indicates that the samples were subjected to alteration under high temperatures, with sufficiently sulphidic and limited reactive Fe availability conditions for MoS 2 formation during late diagenesis. The Fe in pyrite decreased across the mass extinction boundary, which coincided with the highest total Mo amount with the MoS 2 and MoO 3 species. These trends reflected a decrease in reactive Fe in the sediments and contemporaneous seawaters under sulphidic conditions. The low reactive Fe condition could be due to massive pyrite formation under prolonged sulphidic water conditions in the pelagic and ambient continental margin regions in the end-Permian.},

abstract = {Few topics in geobiology have been as extensively debated as the role of Earth's oxygenation in controlling when and why animals emerged and diversified. All currently described animals require oxygen for at least a portion of their life cycle. Therefore, the transition to an oxygenated planet was a prerequisite for the emergence of animals. Yet, our understanding of Earth's oxygenation and the environmental requirements of animal habitability and ecological success is currently limited; estimates for the timing of the appearance of environments sufficiently oxygenated to support ecologically stable populations of animals span a wide range, from billions of years to only a few million years before animals appear in the fossil record. In this light, the extent to which oxygen played an important role in controlling when animals appeared remains a topic of debate. When animals originated and when they diversified are separate questions, meaning either one or both of these phenomena could have been decoupled from oxygenation. Here, we present views from across this interpretive spectrum—in a point–counterpoint format—regarding crucial aspects of the potential links between animals and surface oxygen levels. We highlight areas where the standard discourse on this topic requires a change of course and note that several traditional arguments in this “life versus environment” debate are poorly founded. We also identify a clear need for basic research across a range of fields to disentangle the relationships between oxygen availability and emergence and diversification of animal life.},

abstract = {<p>Calcium is an essential element in the biogeochemical cycles that regulate the long-term climate state of Earth. The removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from the ocean-atmosphere system is controlled by the burial of carbonate sediments (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), ultimately linking the global calcium and carbon cycles. This fundamental link has driven the development of the stable calcium isotope proxy with application to both ancient skeletal and non-skeletal bulk carbonate sediments. Calcium isotope ratios ($\delta$<sup>44/40</sup>Ca) have been used to track long-term changes in seawater chemistry (e.g., aragonite vs. calcite seas) and to elucidate short-term climatic perturbations associated with mass extinction events. However, developments in the calcium isotope proxy have shown that $\delta$<sup>44/40</sup>Ca values in carbonate minerals also are sensitive to changes in precipitation rates, mineralogy and diagenesis, thereby complicating the application of the proxy to the reconstruction of global cycles. First, inorganic carbonate precipitation experiments have demonstrated that carbonate $\delta$<sup>44/40</sup>Ca values are sensitive to precipitation rates with higher rates generally leading to larger fractionation. Second, $\delta$<sup>44/40</sup>Ca values are sensitive to carbonate mineralogy with inorganic aragonite and calcite being on average $\sim$ 1.5‰ and $\sim$ 0.9‰ depleted relative to contemporaneous seawater, respectively. The effects of both changes in carbonate mineralogy and precipitation rates affect primary and secondary minerals, but are particularly pronounced during carbonate diagenesis where relatively slow rates of recrystallization and neomorphism can lead to significant changes in bulk sediment $\delta$<sup>44/40</sup>Ca values. Third, changes in faunal composition expressed in skeletal fossil archives can lead to large changes in carbonate $\delta$<sup>44/40</sup>Ca values that are decoupled from changes in global cycles. Nevertheless, when these factors are appropriately considered the application of calcium isotopes in ancient carbonate sediments becomes a powerful tool for understanding biogeochemical processes that operate over many scales; from diagenetic changes within the sediment pore-space, to regional changes across ancient carbonate platforms, and to global changes in seawater chemistry through time. Importantly, the processes that contribute to variability in carbonate $\delta$<sup>44/40</sup>Ca values are likely to impact other carbonate-bound proxies, highlighting the potential for calcium isotopes as a hint to better understand the variability of other isotope systems.</p>},

abstract = {Banded iron formations were a prevalent feature of marine sedimentation $\sim$3.8-1.8 billion years ago and they provide key evidence for ferruginous oceans. The disappearance of banded iron formations at $\sim$1.8 billion years ago was traditionally taken as evidence for the demise of ferruginous oceans, but recent geochemical studies show that ferruginous conditions persisted throughout the later Precambrian, and were even a feature of Phanerozoic ocean anoxic events. Here, to reconcile these observations, we track the evolution of oceanic Fe-concentrations by considering the temporal record of banded iron formations and marine red beds. We find that marine red beds are a prominent feature of the sedimentary record since the middle Ediacaran ($\sim$580 million years ago). Geochemical analyses and thermodynamic modelling reveal that marine red beds formed when deep-ocean Fe-concentrations were > 4 nM. By contrast, banded iron formations formed when Fe-concentrations were much higher (> 50 $\mu$M). Thus, the first widespread development of marine red beds constrains the timing of deep-ocean oxygenation.},

abstract = {The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE, c. 182 Ma) represents a major perturbation of the carbon cycle marked by widespread black shale deposition. Consequently, the onset of the T-OAE has been linked to the combined effects of global warming, high productivity, basin restriction and salinity stratification. However, the processes that led to termination of the event remain elusive. Here, we present palynological data from Arctic Siberia (Russia), the Viking Corridor (offshore Norway) and the Yorkshire Coast (UK), all spanning the upper Pliensbachian - upper Toarcian stages. Rather than a 'dinoflagellate cyst black-out', as recorded in T-OAE strata of NW Europe, both the Arctic and Viking Corridor records show high abundance and dinoflagellate diversity throughout the T-OAE interval as calibrated by C-isotope records. Significantly, in the Arctic Sea and Viking Corridor, numerous species of the Parvocysta and Phallocysta suites make their first appearance in the lower Toarcian Falciferum Zone much earlier than in Europe, where these key dinoflagellate species appeared suddenly during the Bifrons Zone. Our results indicate migrations of Arctic dinoflagellate species, driven by relative sea-level rise in the Viking Corridor and the establishment of a S-directed circulation from the Arctic Sea into the Tethys Ocean. The results support oceanographic models, but are at odds with some interpretations based on geochemical proxies. The migration of Arctic dinoflagellate species coincides with the end of the T-OAE and marks the arrival of oxygenated, low-salinity Arctic waters, triggering a regime change from persistent euxinia to more dynamic oxygen conditions.},

However, molybdenum-isotope data are often subject to multiple conflicting interpretations. Here I present a compilation of molybdenum-isotope data from three time intervals: the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event about 183 million years ago, Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 about 94 million years ago, and two early Eocene hyperthermal events from 56 to 54 million years ago. A comparison of data from sites located in different hydrographic settings tightly constrains the molybdenum cycle for these intervals, allowing a direct comparison of the expanse of sulfidic conditions in each interval compared to today. Nonetheless, tracing rates of redox change over such rapid climatic events using molybdenum isotopes remains challenging. Future efforts to achieve this goal might be accomplished by analysing specific mineral phases, using complementary redox-sensitive geochemical techniques and by linking isotopic observations with Earth system modelling. Such improvements will make it possible to more fully assess the links between ocean deoxygenation, climatic and oceanographic changes, and biotic turnover.},

abstract = {The terminal Ediacaran Period witnessed the decline of the Ediacara biota (which may have included many stem-group animals). To test whether oceanic anoxia might have played a role in this evolutionary event, we measured U isotope compositions (d238U) in sedimentary carbonates from the Dengying Formation of South China to obtain new constraints on the extent of global redox change during the terminal Ediacaran. We found the most negative carbonate d238U values yet reported (−0.95 per mil), which were reproduced in two widely spaced coeval sections spanning the terminal Ediacaran Period (551 to 541 million years ago). Mass balance modeling indicates an episode of extensive oceanic anoxia, during which anoxia covered >21% of the seafloor and most U entering the oceans was removed into sediments below anoxic waters. The results suggest that an expansion of oceanic anoxia and temporal-spatial redox heterogeneity, independent of other environmental and ecological factors, may have contributed to the decline of the Ediacara biota and may have also stimulated animal motility.},

abstract = {The redox chemistry of anoxic continental margin settings evolved from widespread sulfide-containing (euxinic) conditions to a global ferruginous (iron-containing) state in the early Neoproterozoic era (from $\sim$1 to 0.8 billion years ago). Ocean redox chemistry exerts a strong control on the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus, a limiting nutrient, and hence on primary production, but the response of the phosphorus cycle to this major ocean redox transition has not been investigated. Here, we use a geochemical speciation technique to investigate the phase partitioning of phosphorus in an open marine, early Neoproterozoic succession from the Huainan Basin, North China. We find that effective removal of bioavailable phosphorus in association with iron minerals in a globally ferruginous ocean resulted in oligotrophic (nutrient limited) conditions, and hence a probable global decrease in primary production, organic carbon burial and, subsequently, oxygen production. Nevertheless, phosphorus availability and organic carbon burial were sufficient to maintain an oxidizing atmosphere. These data imply substantial nutrient-driven variability in atmospheric oxygen levels through the Proterozoic, rather than the stable levels commonly invoked.},

abstract = {Anoxic and iron-rich oceanic conditions prevailed throughout most of the Archean and Proterozoic (4000 to c.540 million years ago, Ma), but the oceans are hypothesised to have become progressively oxygen-rich during the Ediacaran–Cambrian transition interval, coincident with the rise of animal life. We utilise the uranium isotope ratio of seawater (238U/235U; reformulated as $\delta$238U), an effective tracer of oceanic redox conditions, as a proxy for changes in the global proportion of anoxic seafloor. We present a new $\delta$238U dataset for carbonate rocks from the Lower Nama Group, Namibia, deposited in a shelf ramp succession during the terminal Neoproterozoic (∼550 to ∼547 Ma). These data capture a transition from $\delta$238U similar to the modern ocean towards persistently low $\delta$238U (average = −0.81 ± 0.06‰). Such low $\delta$238U are consistent with enhanced U drawdown from the water column under anoxic conditions, and the preferential export of ‘heavy' 238U to sediments following U(VI)–U(IV) reduction. Placing our results into a steady state ocean box model suggests at least a third of the global seafloor was covered by anoxic bottom waters compared with only 0.3% in today's oxygenated oceans. Comparison with $\delta$238U from older sediments deposited in other basins further supports an expansion of anoxic bottom waters towards the end of the Ediacaran. Our data are consistent with an emerging picture of a dominantly anoxic Ediacaran ocean punctuated by brief ocean oxygenation events. In the Nama Group, the transition towards globally widespread anoxic conditions post-dates the first appearance of both skeletal metazoans and soft-bodied fauna of the Nama Assemblage. This suggests that the global expansion of anoxia did not coincide with the decline of the Ediacaran biota, or drive the biotic turnover between the White Sea and Nama Assemblages. The impact of this global redox change on metazoan ecosystems is unclear, since the expansion of anoxia, if contained mainly within deeper waters, may not have impinged significantly upon continental shelves that host the majority of biodiversity.},

It is a puzzling paradox that fossils of benthic animals are often found in black shales with geochemical evidence for deposition in marine environments with anoxic and sulfidic bottom waters. It is debated whether the geochemical proxies are unreliable, affected by diagenesis, or whether the fossils are transported from afar or perhaps were not benthic. Here, we improved the stratigraphic resolution of marine anoxia records 100–1000 fold using core-scanning X-Ray Fluorescence and established a centennial resolution record of oxygen availability at the seafloor in an epicontinental sea that existed $\sim$501–494 million years ago. The study reveals that anoxic bottom-water conditions, often with toxic hydrogen sulfide present, were interrupted by brief oxygenation events of 600–3000 years duration, corresponding to 1–5 mm stratigraphic thickness. Fossil shells occur in some of these oxygenated intervals suggesting that animals invaded when conditions permitted an aerobic life style at the seafloor. Although the fauna evidently comprised opportunistic species adapted to low oxygen environments, these findings reconcile a long-standing debate between paleontologists and geochemists, and shows the potential of ultra-high resolution analyses for reconstructing redox conditions in past oceans.},

Corresponding depletion of 18O in surface waters would have resulted in lower $\delta$18O of marine carbonates deposited on continental shelves. Modeling of paleoceanographic isotopic data suggests that this "storage" effect is similar in magnitude (but opposite in sign) to that of modern enrichment of 18O in the oceans by glacial storage. Modeling of carbonate compositions through time that takes into account such storage effects (as predicted by changing global climate) suggests that large changes in the mean oceanic isotopic composition, but neither extreme temperatures nor sudden changes in mean ocean compositions, are needed to explain the isotopic record. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

Here, we report parallel positive uranium, carbon, and sulphur isotope excursions from carbonate successions in Siberia that document a brief global oxygenation episode 521-520 Myr ago, at the onset of diversification of larger arthropods known from the fossil record. Our data and model indicate that an abrupt increase in the sinking rate of marine organic matter expanded the oxygenated zone in the oceans and that reducing conditions returned 1.3 ± 0.8 Myr after the onset of this transient oxygenation episode, necessitating a strong negative feedback to the increasing levels of oxygen. We speculate that larger zooplankton could have sourced both oxygen and food to the seafloor, fueling bioturbation over wider areas and, thereby, stabilising O2-rich habitats in the oceans. Thus, this reorganisation exemplifies how animal ecosystems might have influenced oxygen availability in Earth's surface environment soon after their establishment.},

abstract = {The role of oxygen as a driver for early animal evolution is widely debated. During the Cambrian explosion, episodic radiations of major animal phyla occurred coincident with repeated carbon isotope fluctuations. However, the driver of these isotope fluctuations and potential links to environmental oxygenation are unclear. Here we report high-resolution carbon and sulfur isotope data for marine carbonates from the southeastern Siberian Platform that document the canonical explosive phase of the Cambrian radiation from $\sim$524 to $\sim$514 Myr ago. These analyses demonstrate a strong positive covariation between carbonate $\delta$13C and carbonate-associated sulfate $\delta$34S through five isotope cycles. Biogeochemical modelling suggests that this isotopic coupling reflects periodic oscillations in the atmospheric O2 and the extent of shallow-ocean oxygenation. Episodic maxima in the biodiversity of animal phyla directly coincided with these extreme oxygen perturbations. Conversely, the subsequent Botoman–Toyonian animal extinction events ($\sim$514 to $\sim$512 Myr ago) coincided with decoupled isotope records that suggest a shrinking marine sulfate reservoir and expanded shallow marine anoxia. We suggest that fluctuations in oxygen availability in the shallow marine realm exerted a primary control on the timing and tempo of biodiversity radiations at a crucial phase in the early history of animal life.},

abstract = {The early-middle Cambrian (Fortunian to Age 4) is characterized by a significant increase in metazoan diversification. Furthermore, this interval is marked by a prominent environmental and ecological expansion of arthropod- and echinoderm-rich biotas. Recent redox work has suggested that this shift occurred during stable or decreasing marine oxygen levels, suggesting that these paleobiological and paleoecological transformations were decoupled from a redox control. We tested this idea by conducting new paleoredox analyses on Age 2-Age 4 Cambrian outer shelf (Jiuqunao-Wangjiaping), slope (Wuhe-Geyi), and basinal (Zhalagou) sections of the South China Craton. Multiple sections indicate that mid-depth waters transitioned from anoxic conditions during Cambrian Age 2 to stable oxic conditions during Cambrian Age 4. These findings suggest a stepwise expansion of oxic waters from shallow to deep settings during the early-middle Cambrian, consistent with a redox control of metazoan diversification and ecological expansion. More broadly, despite the surge in redox work over the past decade, this study highlights the need for continued coupled redox and paleontological studies to directly test models about the links between the evolution of animals, ecosystems, and marine redox conditions.},

abstract = {The Smithian/Spathian boundary (SSB) represents a major climatic-oceanic-biotic event within the $\sim$5-Myr-long recovery interval of the Early Triassic following the end-Permian mass extinction. The SSB was associated with pronounced cooling following the middle Smithian hyper-greenhouse, a $\sim$ +2 to +8‰ positive carbon isotope excursion, and a second-order mass extinction, yet its underlying cause(s) remain poorly understood. Here, we review oceanic environmental changes during the middle Smithian to early Spathian interval and their potential mechanisms. In addition, we undertook an analysis of the carbon‑sulfur‑iron (C-S-Fe) systematics of the South Majiashan section, which was located on the paleo-western margin of the South China Craton during the Early Triassic, to better understand the causation of these environmental changes. This analysis revealed low $\delta$13Ccarb (i.e., the N3 minimum) in the middle Smithian but rapidly rising $\delta$13Ccarb (i.e., to the P3 maximum) and $\delta$34SCAS within the SSB interval (i.e., late Smithian-earliest Spathian). Both the middle Smithian and SSB intervals are marked by development of marine euxinia, which we hypothesize had fundamentally different causes. The middle Smithian was associated with hyperwarming (the “Smithian Thermal Maximum”), which was probably triggered by a peak in magmatic activity of the Siberian Traps LIP. In contrast, the SSB interval was associated with global climatic cooling, which may have stimulated oceanic overturning circulation and upwelling on continental margins, leading to transient local increases in marine productivity and expansion of oceanic oxygen-minimum zones (OMZs). The concurrent positive excursions in $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$34SCAS at South Majiashan and other sections worldwide are evidence of enhanced burial of organic carbon and pyrite on a regional or global scale, as well as of a concurrent decline in atmospheric pCO2 that may have positively re-enforced the SSB cooling event.},

However, the control that oxygen exerted on the development of early animal ecosystems remains unclear, as previous research has focussed on the identification of fully anoxic or oxic conditions, rather than intermediate redox levels. Here we report anomalous cerium enrichments preserved in carbonate rocks across bathymetric basin transects from nine localities of the Nama Group, Namibia (1/4550-541 Ma). In combination with Fe-based redox proxies, these data suggest that low-oxygen conditions occurred in a narrow zone between well-oxygenated surface waters and fully anoxic deep waters. Although abundant in well-oxygenated environments, early skeletal animals did not occupy oxygen impoverished regions of the shelf, demonstrating that oxygen availability (probably >10 $\mu$M) was a key requirement for the development of early animal-based ecosystems.},

abstract = {Widespread anoxia in the ocean is frequently invoked as a primary driver of mass extinction as well as a long-term inhibitor of evolutionary radiation on early Earth. In recent biogeochemical studies it has been hypothesized that oxygen deficiency was widespread in subsurface water masses of later Cambrian oceans, possibly influencing evolutionary events during this time. Physical evidence of widespread anoxia in Cambrian oceans has remained elusive and thus its potential relationship to the palaeontological record remains largely unexplored. Here we present sulphur isotope records from six globally distributed stratigraphic sections of later Cambrian marine rocks (about 499 million years old). We find a positive sulphur isotope excursion in phase with the Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion (SPICE), a large and rapid excursion in the marine carbon isotope record, which is thought to be indicative of a global carbon cycle perturbation. Numerical box modelling of the paired carbon sulphur isotope data indicates that these isotope shifts reflect transient increases in the burial of organic carbon and pyrite sulphur in sediments deposited under large-scale anoxic and sulphidic (euxinic) conditions. Independently, molybdenum abundances in a coeval black shale point convincingly to the transient spread of anoxia. These results identify the SPICE interval as the best characterized ocean anoxic event in the pre-Mesozoic ocean and an extreme example of oxygen deficiency in the later Cambrian ocean. Thus, a redox structure similar to those in Proterozoic oceans may have persisted or returned in the oceans of the early Phanerozoic eon. Indeed, the environmental challenges presented by widespread anoxia may have been a prevalent if not dominant influence on animal evolution in Cambrian oceans. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Marine redox changes should have played an essential role in both ecological and environmental evolutions; however, temporary changes and spatial distribution of redox conditions in the Ediacaran-Cambrian oceans remain elusive and highly debated. In this study, we analyzed chromium (Cr) isotope and cerium (Ce) anomaly profiles in carbonates from the Upper Ediacaran-Lower Cambrian Dengying and Zhujiaqing formations at the Xiaotan section, South China, in an attempt to provide new insights helping unravel Earth's surface redox changes during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. Our results show that these carbonates record generally positive $\delta$53Crauth values (up to 1.15‰) with fluctuations and prominent negative Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce⁎ values down to 0.35), implying a broad increase in oxygenation in the atmosphere and the inner shelf of the Yangtze Platform during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. The first appearance and subsequent diversification of the Cambrian animals may have benefited from this oxygenation event. The pronounced fluctuations of $\delta$53Crauth and $\delta$13Ccarb values can be explained by episodic oxidation of a deep-water DOC pool in a stratified water column across the chemocline through upwelling, releasing light carbon isotopes and organic-matter-bound isotopically unfractionated Cr (III) into shallow waters.},

abstract = {The oxygenation of the deep ocean in the geological past has been associated with a rise in the partial pressure of atmospheric molecular oxygen (O2) to near-present levels and the emergence of modern marine biogeochemical cycles. It has also been linked to the origination and diversification of early animals. It is generally thought that the deep ocean was largely anoxic from about 2,500 to 800 million years ago, with estimates of the occurrence of deep-ocean oxygenation and the linked increase in the partial pressure of atmospheric oxygen to levels sufficient for this oxygenation ranging from about 800 to 400 million years ago. Deep-ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations over this interval are typically estimated using geochemical signatures preserved in ancient continental shelf or slope sediments, which only indirectly reflect the geochemical state of the deep ocean. Here we present a record that more directly reflects deep-ocean oxygen concentrations, based on the ratio of Fe3+ to total Fe in hydrothermally altered basalts formed in ocean basins. Our data allow for quantitative estimates of deep-ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations from 3.5 billion years ago to 14 million years ago and suggest that deep-ocean oxygenation occurred in the Phanerozoic (541 million years ago to the present) and potentially not until the late Palaeozoic (less than 420 million years ago).},

Our results point to a dynamically viable and highly variable state of atmosphere-ocean oxygenation with 2 massive expansions of seafloor anoxia in the aftermath of a prolonged interval of declining atmospheric pO2 levels. Although animals began diversifying beforehand, there were relatively few new appearances during these dramatic fluctuations in seafloor oxygenation. When O2 levels again rose, it occurred in concert with predicted high rates of photosynthetic production, both of which may have fueled more energy to predators and their armored prey in the evolving marine ecosystem.},

abstract = {The upper Cenomanian - lower Turonian is a key-stratigraphic interval, as it encompasses the Late Cretaceous supergreenhouse and a major perturbation of the global carbon cycle (i. e., Oceanic Anoxic Event 2) as evidenced by a global positive carbon isotope excursion and by the nearly world-wide deposition of organic-rich marine facies. A turnover in planktonic foraminiferal assemblages and in other marine organisms is documented across this stratigraphic interval, but reconstruction of the timing and identification of the cause and effect relationships between environmental perturbations and organism response require a highly- resolved stratigraphic framework. The appearance and extinction levels of planktonic foraminiferal species generally allow accurate intra- and supra-basinal correlations. However, bioevents cannot be assumed to be globally synchronous, because the stratigraphic and geographic distribution of species is modulated by ecological preferences exhibited by each taxon and controlled by oceanic circulation, often resulting in earlier or delayed events in certain geographic areas (i. e., diachronous datums). The aim of this study is to test the synchronicity of the planktonic foraminiferal bioevents recognized across the C/T boundary and to provide the most reliable sequence of events for correlation of low to mid-latitude localities. For this purpose, we have compiled a highly-resolved biostratigraphic analysis of the European reference section for the C/T boundary at Eastbourne, Gun Gardens (UK), and core S57 (Tarfaya, Morocco), and correlated the sequence of bioevents identified with those recorded in other coeval sections available in the literature, including the GSSP section for the base of the Turonian Stage at Rock Canyon, Pueblo (Colorado), where we calculated reliable estimates of planktonic foraminiferal events that are well-constrained by radioisotopically and astrochronologically dated bentonite layers. Results indicate that the extinctions of Thalmanninella deeckei, Thalmanninella greenhornensis, Rotalipora cushmani and "Globigerinelloides" bentonensis in the latest Cenomanian are reliable bioevents for correlation. In addition, our analysis highlights other promising lowest occurrences (LOs) that need to be better constrained by bio- and chemostratigraphy, including the LO of Marginotruncana schneegansi falling close to the C/T boundary. By contrast, the appearance of Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica and of some Dicarinella species, the extinction of anaticinellids and the onset of the "Heterohelix" shift are likely diachronous across low to mid-latitude localities. Finally, our study suggests that different species concepts among authors, different sample size and sampling resolution, as well as species paleoecology are important factors that control the stratigraphic position at which bioevents are identified.},

Thus, the secular variation of $\delta$34Spy records the history of marine and atmosphere redox evolution. As such, large magnitude change in $\delta$34Spy in the Proterozoic has been attributed to widespread oceanic anoxia related to generally low atmospheric pO2 levels. However, noisy $\delta$34Spy signals in the past 250 million years cannot be explained by the frequent oscillation of seawater redox, because the global ocean was already fully oxidized. Here, by developing a numerical model, we show that $\delta$34Spy of syndepositional pyrite is significantly affected by local factors, such as organic matter content in sediment, sedimentation rate, and seafloor redox. Thus, the noisy $\delta$34Spy records may reflect local environmental variations rather than the oscillation of global ocean redox. Our study also suggests that $\delta$34Spy alone cannot provide a robust constraint on the global or local ocean redox condition. We suggest that, combining with the pyrite content data and $\delta$34Spy can help quantify local/regional biogeochemical cycles.},

abstract = {Carbonate oceanic red beds (ORBs) are unusual in Phanerozoic shelf settings but can be widespread during discrete intervals. Several scenarios have been invoked to explain the origin of these ORBs but there remains uncertainty about the process by which the red pigmentation of ORBs forms. Here, we propose that the occurrence of ORBs at intermediate water depths in shelf regions is controlled by fluctuations in the redox state of deeper waters. We have examined Early Triassic Peri-Gondwana shelf sections in South Tibet which show the development of Spathian (late Early Triassic) ORBs at intermediate water depths. The red color of these ORBs is imparted by randomly dispersed hematite crystals that are microns in size, showing weak alteration by late burial diagenesis. Widespread anoxia, in both shelf seas and the oceanic realm, was well developed in the Early Triassic. Synchronous occurrence of Spathian ORBs in deep shelf regions is closely related to the improved oxidation in deeper settings, from anoxia to dysoxia, based on changes in the redox proxy of pyrite framboid sizes. It is, therefore, inferred that prolonged deep-water anoxia might serve as source of Fe (II) for the formation of ORBs when intensified upwelling develops. The global occurrence of Early Triassic ORBs is coincident with the significant rebound of biodiversity after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, indicating the occurrence of ORBs marks the terminal stage of an oceanic anoxic event and ORBs can serve as an indicator of the ameliorated marine ecosystem.},

Also reviewed are the various processes regulating oxygen concentrations, and several models of Precambrian oxygen evolution are presented.

abstract = {The macronutrient phosphorus is thought to limit primary productivity in the oceans on geological timescales. Although there has been a sustained effort to reconstruct the dynamics of the phosphorus cycle over the past 3.5 billion years, it remains uncertain whether phosphorus limitation persisted throughout Earth's history and therefore whether the phosphorus cycle has consistently modulated biospheric productivity and ocean-atmosphere oxygen levels over time. Here we present a compilation of phosphorus abundances in marine sedimentary rocks spanning the past 3.5 billion years. We find evidence for relatively low authigenic phosphorus burial in shallow marine environments until about 800 to 700 million years ago. Our interpretation of the database leads us to propose that limited marginal phosphorus burial before that time was linked to phosphorus biolimitation, resulting in elemental stoichiometries in primary producers that diverged strongly from the Redfield ratio (the atomic ratio of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus found in phytoplankton). We place our phosphorus record in a quantitative biogeochemical model framework and find that a combination of enhanced phosphorus scavenging in anoxic, iron-rich oceans and a nutrient-based bistability in atmospheric oxygen levels could have resulted in a stable low-oxygen world. The combination of these factors may explain the protracted oxygenation of Earth's surface over the last 3.5 billion years of Earth history. However, our analysis also suggests that a fundamental shift in the phosphorus cycle may have occurred during the late Proterozoic eon (between 800 and 635 million years ago), coincident with a previously inferred shift in marine redox states, severe perturbations to Earth's climate system, and the emergence of animals.},

abstract = {Shallow marine benthic microbial carbonate sediments declined episodically during the Phanerozoic. They were relatively abundant during the Cambrian/mid-Ordovician, late Devonian/Mississippian, mid-Permian/mid-late Triassic, and to a lesser degree in the late Jurassic/early Cretaceous. They were least abundant when invertebrate, especially reef, diversity was relatively high in the mid-Ordovician/late Devonian, early-mid Permian, late Triassic, mid-late Jurassic, and early Cretaceous to present-day. These intervals of microbial carbonate abundance and invertebrate diversity generally alternate transitionally with one-another; but ‘lows' and periods of overlap also occur. ‘Lows' when benthic microbial carbonate abundance and invertebrate diversity both declined, are apparent during the Pennsylvanian and early-mid Jurassic. Overlaps, when microbial carbonates and invertebrates were both relatively common, occur in the early Cambrian and late Jurassic. Overall, these patterns broadly support suggestions that microbial carbonate abundance declined as calcified invertebrates increased. To further explore these relationships, we compared microbial carbonate abundance and invertebrate diversity with estimates of changes in sea-surface temperature and marine dissolved oxygen for the past 490 Myr. This analysis suggests that invertebrate diversity varied directly with oxygen availability. Invertebrate diversity was low when dissolved oxygen was low in the early Ordovician, late Devonian, early Triassic, and early-mid Jurassic. It appears that, by reducing invertebrate diversity, low oxygen levels favored microbial carbonates. At the same time, low oxygen levels likely stimulated anaerobic metabolisms favoring carbonate precipitation. This study suggests that dissolved oxygen was a major control on secular patterns of marine microbial carbonate abundance during the Phanerozoic, together with marine temperature and carbonate saturation state.},

abstract = {The Frasnian-Famennian boundary records one of the most catastrophic mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic Eon. Several possible causes for this extinction have been suggested, including extra-terrestrial impacts and large-scale volcanism. However, linking the extinction with these potential causes is hindered by the lack of precise dating of either the extinction or volcanic/impact events. In this study, a bentonite layer in uppermost-Frasnian sediments from Steinbruch Schmidt (Germany) is re-analysed using CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb zircon geochronology in order to constrain the date of the Frasnian-Famennian extinction. A new age of 372.36 ± 0.053 Ma is determined for this bentonite, confirming a date no older than 372.4 Ma for the Frasnian-Famennian boundary, which can be further constrained to 371.93-371.78 Ma using a pre-existing Late Devonian age model. This age is consistent with previous dates, but is significantly more precise. When compared with published ages of the Siljan impact crater and basalts produced by large-scale volcanism, there is no apparent correlation between the extinction and either phenomenon, not clearly supporting them as a direct cause for the Frasnian-Famennian event. This result highlights an urgent need for further Late Devonian geochronological and chemostratigraphic work to better understand the cause(s) of this extinction.},

abstract = {The first trees in New York were Middle Devonian (earliest Givetian) cladoxyls (?Duisbergia and Wattieza), with shallow-rooted manoxylic trunks. Cladoxyl trees in New York thus postdate their latest Emsian evolution in Spitzbergen. Progymnosperm trees (?Svalbardia and Callixylon-Archaeopteris) appeared in New York later (mid-Givetian) than progymnosperm trees from Spitzbergen (early Givetian). Associated paleosols are evidence that Wattieza formed intertidal to estuarine mangal and Callixylon formed dry riparian woodland. Also from paleosols comes evidence that Wattieza and Callixylon required about 350mm more mean annual precipitation than plants of equivalent stature today, that Wattieza tolerated mean annual temperature 7°C less than current limits of mangal (20°C), and Callixylon could tolerate temperatures 14°C less than modern mangal. Devonian mangal and riparian woodland spread into New York from wetter regions elsewhere during transient paleoclimatic spikes of very high CO2 (3923±238 ppmv), and subhumid (mean annual precipitation 730±147mm) conditions, which were more likely extrinsic atmospheric perturbations rather than consequences of tree evolution. For most of the Middle Devonian CO2 was lower (2263±238 ppmv), and paleoclimate in New York was semiarid (mean annual precipitation 484±147mm). Such transient perturbations and immigration events may explain the 40million year gap between the late Emsian (400Ma) evolution of trees and Famennian (360Ma) CO2 drawdown and expansion of ice caps. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

If the flow exhibits collapses, the authors consider how topography and wind stress affect the ensuing oscillations. Large-scale slope up toward the north or the west can significantly destabilize the circulation by modifying the barotropic flow and reducing the depth of convection. Wind stress stabilizes the circulation by deepening the thermocline in the subtropical gyre. Wind driving can also radically reduce the period of oscillations by destabilizing the northern halocline in the collapsed phase. The overall period of the oscillation is usually governed by the time taken for diffusive warming to destabilize the deep ocean.},

abstract = {During the Devonian (419 to 359 million years ago), life on Earth witnessed decisive evolutionary breakthroughs, most prominently the colonization of land by vascular plants and vertebrates. However, it was also a period of major marine extinctions coinciding with marked changes in climate. The cause of these changes remains unknown, and it is therefore instructive to explore systematically how the Devonian climate responds to changes in boundary conditions. Here we use coupled climate model simulations to investigate separately the influence of changes in continental configuration, vegetation cover, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, the solar constant, and orbital parameters on the Devonian climate. The biogeophysical effect of changes in vegetation cover is small, and the cooling due to continental drift is offset by the increasing solar constant. Variations of orbital parameters affect the Devonian climate, with the warmest climate states at high obliquity and high eccentricity. The prevailing mode of decadal to centennial climate variability relates to temperature fluctuations in high northern latitudes which are mediated by coupled oscillations involving sea ice cover, ocean convection, and a regional overturning circulation. The temperature evolution during the Devonian is dominated by the strong decrease in atmospheric CO2. Albedo changes due to increasing vegetation cover cannot explain the temperature rise found in Late Devonian proxy data. Finally, simulated temperatures are significantly lower than estimates based on oxygen isotope ratios, suggesting a lower $\delta$18O ratio of Devonian seawater.},

abstract = {Land plants invaded continents during the Mid-Paleozoic. Their spreading and diversification have been compared to the Cambrian explosion in terms of intensity and impact on the diversification of life on Earth. Whereas prior studies were focused on the evolution of the root system and its weathering contribution, here we used a coupled climate/carbon/vegetation model to investigate the biophysical impacts of plant colonization on the surface climate through changes in continental albedo, roughness, thermal properties, and potential evaporation. From the Early to the Late Devonian, our model simulates a significant atmospheric CO2 drop from 6300 to 2100ppmv that is due to an increase in the consumption of CO2 though continental silicate weathering. The continental drift and the climatic changes promoted by land plants explain this trend. The simulated CO2 drawdown is paradoxically associated with unchanged temperatures. We show here that the CO2 drop is counteracted by a large warming resulting from the surface albedo reduction caused by the appearance of an extended plant-cover. If CO2 is consensually assumed as the main driver of the Phanerozoic climate, this paper demonstrates that, during land-plant invasion, the modifications of soil properties could have played in the opposite direction of the carbon dioxide fall, hence maintaining warm temperatures during part of the Devonian. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Million year-scale (3rd-order) depositional sequences (few 10s to $\sim$ 100 m-thick) are common in the Devonian marine record and are correlated between sedimentary basins and across widely separated continents implying a eustatic origin. Tectonically driven changes in mid-ocean ridge spreading rates/lengths are too slow to account for the calculated 3rd-order rise/fall rates and typical orbital frequencies ($\sim$ 20-400 ky) are too fast. We analyzed oxygen isotopes from conodont apatite to evaluate if Early-Middle Devonian 3rd-order sea-level changes were controlled by paleoclimatically driven ice volume (glacio-eustasy) and seawater temperature change (thermo-eustasy). Two successive depositional sequences in the western U.S. (Nevada) and Czech Republic (Prague Basin) were sampled. The $\delta$18O values range from 17.8‰ to 20.2‰ (SMOW) and show similar trends across the Emsian-Eifelian boundary with increasing and peak values in the lower costatus, decreasing values in the mid costatus, and increasing values in the upper costatus to australis zones. The similarities between these widely separated localities indicate that the isotopic trends are global rather than controlled by local variations in seawater temperature, evaporation/freshwater influx, or diagenesis. In the Nevada section, where the sea-level history is the most complete and best understood, the isotopic values increase and peak in late highstand and lowstand system tracts and decrease to the lowest values in the transgressive and maximum flooding intervals suggesting the My-scale sea-level changes were paleoclimatically controlled. The magnitude of isotopic shift from lowstand to maximum flooding intervals ranges from 0.8‰ to 1.5‰ and occurred over time spans of < 1.7 My. The only known mechanism to explain such large and rapid isotopic shifts is glacio-eustasy. If a reasonable range of My-scale subtropical sea surface temperature changes are assumed ($\sim$ 1-3 °C), then this requires glacio-eustatic sea-level changes of > 35 m to explain the remaining isotopic shifts. These amplitudes imply that significant continental ice sheets grew and melted on the < 1.7 My time scales during the Early-Middle Devonian and, like recent reports for the mid-Cretaceous and early Eocene, challenge previous assumptions of ice-free greenhouse climates. A plausible climate driver for these My-scale paleoclimate changes is long-period eccentricity ($\sim$ 2.4 My) and obliquity ($\sim$ 1.2 My) variations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The impact of climate change on biodiversity has been the focus of studies on the Phanerozoic biotic crises. However, it is still controversial whether climate change has caused the Frasnian–Famennian (F–F) biotic crisis since there is no unequivocal view on the global climate change during this critical period. In order to reconstruct palaeotemperatures during the F–F transition in South China (eastern Palaeotethys), a high-resolution oxygen isotope ($\delta$18OPO4) record was obtained based on 104 measurements of conodont apatite from the Yangdi section. The oxygen isotope record based on mono-generic samples reveals an increase in $\delta$18OPO4 by 0.7‰ in the Lower Kellwasser horizon (LKH) and 1.4‰ in the Upper Kellwasser horizon (UKH), translating into low-latitude surface water cooling of ∼3 °C and ∼6 °C, respectively. These two $\delta$18OPO4 shifts agree well with the time-equivalent $\delta$18OPO4 records from the western Palaeotethys, suggesting that two climate cooling pulses in conjunction with the deposition of the Kellwasser horizons are a global signal during the F–F transition. The positive shift of $\delta$18OPO4 coincides with positive excursion in carbon isotope of carbonates ($\delta$13Ccarb) in the UKH, indicating that enhanced burial of organic carbon resulted in a drop in atmospheric pCO2 and thus global climate cooling. Cooling started immediately before the Upper Kellwasser biotic crisis, with the lowest temperature documented at the top of the UKH. Climate cooling during the deposition of the LKH is observed in conjunction with the sharp decline in metazoan reefs. The coincidence of cooling and the Kellwasser biotic crisis suggests that global cooling played a major role in the collapse of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Late Devonian mass extinctions attributed to extensive anoxia and/or euxinia of the oceans are associated with widespread deposition of organic-rich shales. Also in the epeiric waters of the Canning Basin (Western Australia), photic zone euxinia (PZE) prevailed during the Givetian–Frasnian, with geochemical evidence for PZE on the northern (Lennard Shelf)– and southern (Barbwire Terrace) margins of the Fitzroy Trough. On the Lennard Shelf, shales record episodic pulses of PZE associated with high algal activity due to enhanced nutrient supply, whereas a restricted marine setting on the Barbwire Terrace is thought to be the main driver for the development of persistent PZE and associated bacterial predominance. Structural evidence indicates that the Fitzroy Trough was a confined basin during the Late Devonian with the possibility of limited ocean circulation. Widespread PZE is expected to have developed in the poorly mixed water column, if the basin received sufficient nutrient supply for enhanced primary production. Notwithstanding the presence of anoxia during deposition of potential source rocks, only two small Devonian-sourced oil fields and numerous oil shows have been found in the Canning Basin. Biomarker assemblages show that the oils produced from the Lennard Shelf fields (i.e. Blina-1, Blina-4 and Janpam North-1) have substantially different molecular compositions to the minor oil recovered from Mirbelia-1 on the Barbwire Terrace. A correlation was established between the Lennard Shelf oils and rock extracts from the Gogo Formation at Blina-1 and McWhae Ridge-1 based on their hopane, sterane and carotenoids abundances. A definitive source correlation was not obtained for the Mirbelia-1 oil, but it did show some genetic affinity to the Givetian–Frasnian extracts from the Barbwire Terrace, suggesting that local source rocks are developed in the region.},

abstract = {A model of the global biogeochemical cycles coupled to a energy-balance climate model (the COMBINE model) is used to identify the causes of two large $\delta$13C value excursions across the Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) boundary. We test a scenario that links the sea-level rise to stratification of the Proto-Tethys ocean through the formation of warm saline deep waters in extended epicontinental seas. Even though this scenario can produce dysoxia below 100 m depth, it fails to increase the global burial flux of organic carbon and thus seawater $\delta$13C values, since stratification of the ocean leads to decreased productivity in surface waters. Several scenarios postulating a continental origin of the perturbations in the Late Devonian biogeochemical cycles are then tested. We found that weathering of platform carbonates exposed during the Early Famennian sea-level fall can account for a maximum positive shift in $\delta$13C value of +0.7‰ at the end of the sea-level fall episode. Another +1.0‰ increase in $\delta$ 13C might originate from rapid spreading of vascular land plants near the F-F boundary, postulating that higher plants globally increased the weatherability of continental surface, and that colonized continental area increased by 30% across the F-F boundary. Finally, the $\delta$13C excursion observed at the base of Upper rhenana Zone and the rapid increase of the carbon isotope ratios at the F-F boundary require an increase of phosphorus delivery to the ocean by 40%, coeval with the sea-level rises. Once the calculated $\delta$13C values are in agreement with the measured data, the COMBINE model calculates a decrease in atmospheric pCO2 from pre-perturbation 2925 ppmv in the Lower rhenana conodont Zone to 1560 ppmv in the Upper triangularis Zone. This decrease in pCO2 is due to the increase in burial of organic matter during the Kellwasser events, and increased continental weatherability triggered by the spreading of continental vascular plants. These changes occur within 4 million years. The corresponding global climatic cooling reaches 4.4°C at the pole, and 2.1°C at the equator. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Late Devonian (383-359 Ma) was a time of prolonged climate instability with catastrophic perturbation of global marine ecosystems at the Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) and the Devonian-Carboniferous (D-C) boundaries. The causes and mechanisms of anoxia and extinction at the F-F interval are not clearly delineated, and alternative explanations for virtually every aspect of this interval are still intensely debated. In many (but not all) locations, the F-F interval is characterized by two dark, organic-rich lithologies: the Lower and Upper Kellwasser beds (as originally described in Germany) that represent a stepwise ocean anoxia and extinction sequence. The Upper and Lower Kellwasser anoxia event beds are often collectively termed the Kellwasser Event, and the termination of this sequence is within the Upper Kellwasser Event at the F-F boundary. Current knowledge is limited by significant sampling bias, as most previous studies sampled epicontinental seaways or passive continental shelves, primarily from localities across Europe and North America. Together these formed a single equatorial continent with a rising mountain chain during the Late Devonian. Our understanding of the Kellwasser Event is thus based on data and observations from a restricted set of paleoenvironments that may not represent the complete range of Late Devonian environments and oceanic conditions. In the last decade, new methodologies and research in additional paleoenvironments around the world confirm that the Kellwasser Event was global in scope, but also that its expression varies with both paleoenvironment and paleogeography. Studying the many differing geochemical and lithological expressions of the Kellwasser Event using a) a wide variety of paleoenvironments, b) a multiproxy approach, and c) placement of results into the broader context of Late Devonian marine biodiversity patterns is vital for understanding the true scope of ocean anoxia, and determining the causes of the marine biodiversity crisis at the F-F boundary.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We present a new biostratigraphically constrained carbon isotope record from the Lali section (South China) to document perturbations in the Late Devonian carbon cycle. Positive carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) are most important components of the Late Devonian long-term carbon isotope cycle: Frasnes (+2‰), Middlesex (+1‰), Lower Kellwasser (+3‰), Upper Kellwasser (+3‰) and Upper annulata (+1‰) events, as well as a small positive CIE (+1‰) in the Famennian expansa-aculeatus zones were recorded. It is noteworthy that no significant carbon isotope shifts are found for the Rhinestreet, Nehden, Condroz and Enkeberg events. The Late Devonian long-term carbon isotope curve from South China is in agreement with contemporaneous world-wide trends in Euramerica (Europe and North America) and Gondwana. Global data suggests a higher Famennian $\delta$13Ccarb baseline (about +2.5 ‰) than that of the Frasnian (about +1‰). Previous studies have related the positive CIE to ocean anoxia, but its ultimate driver remains unclear. Other interpretations include the spread of land plants or increased tectonic activity, but these explanations are questionable due to the relative short durations of the CIEs compared to long-term processes of plant evolution and plant cover extension as well as tectonic movements.},

abstract = {Palynomorph distribution in Euramerica and western Gondwana, from the Latest Givetian to the Latest Famennian, may be explained, to some extent, by climatic changes. Detailed miospore stratigraphy dates accurately the successive steps of these changes. Interpretation is built on three postulates which are discussed: Euramerica at slightly lower latitudes than generally accepted by most paleomagnetic reconstructions: a conodont time-scale accepted as the most used available subdivision of time; and Late Devonian sea-level fluctuations mainly governed by glacio-eustasy. The Frasnian-Famennian timescale is also evaluated. The comparison, based on conodont correlations, between Givetian and most of the Frasnian miospore assemblages from, respectively, northern and southern Euramerica demonstrates a high taxonomic diversity in the equatorial belt and much difference between supposed equatorial and (sub) tropical vegetations. On the contrary, a similar vegetation pattern and therefore probably compatible climatic conditions were present from tropical to subpolar areas. A rather hot climate culminated during the Latest Frasnian when equatorial miospore assemblages reached their maximum width. The miospore diversity shows also a rather clear global Late Frasnian minimum which is also recorded during the Early and Middle Famennian but only in low latitude regions while, in high latitude, very cold climates without perennial snow may explain the scarcity of miospores and so of vegetation. The Early and Middle Famennian conspicuous latitudinal gradient of the vegetation seems to attenuate towards the Late and Latest Famennian but this might be above all the result of the development, of cosmopolitan coastal lowland vegetations (downstream swamps) depending more on the moisture and equable local microclimates than on the probably adverse climates of distant hinterland areas. During than time, periods of cold climate without perennial snow cover and with rare vegetation may have alternated with less cold but wetter climates, thus giving rise to the development of mountain glaciers in high latitudes and explaining the jerking character of the global major marine regression. In high latitude regions, the development of an ice cap reaching sea level is only recorded by the end of the Latest Famennian, immediately below the DCB but even if glacial evidence are not known at near the FFB, a short (0.1 Ma?) glaciation seems the best reasonable explanation of the major eustatic fall following the Kellwasser Event. The sudden growth and decay of a hypothetical. Earliest Famennian ice sheet can be explained by the reduction and later, increase in greenhouse capacity of the atmosphere. These changes in the atmospheric CO2 might have provoked changes in the mode of ocean-atmosphere operation. It may also be partly controlled by a volcanic paroxysm and/or bolide impacts. The Hony microtektites represent the best known evidence of the impact of extraterrestrial bodies on Earth corresponding to the UKW and they are immediately followed by a regression suggested by the quantitative analysis of acritarch assemblages. In the paleo-tropical Late Famennian a peat-forming vascular plant community occurs for the first time and makes possible quantitative palynology of autochthonous sediments allowing the recognition of different swamp and near-swamp characteristic miospores. The early Latest Famennian starts with a widespread transgression which could correspond to the melting phases of the hypothetical Late Famennian mountain glaciers. During the end-Famennian the coastal lowland vegetation has a worldwide distribution from sub-polar to equatorial regions. The climate has become less cold in high latitudes but wetter than before probably because the midlatitude cyclonic activity allows sufficient polar transportation of moisture to form large snow cover. Extensive coastal glaciers developed in different Bolivian and Brazilian basins, well dated by miospores. Rapid climatic changes characterize the onset of glaciation. The cyclic nature of climate allowed even intertropical marine faunas to reach occasionally the subpolar regions. For the plant kingdom, the crisis which follows the Hangenberg Event was more severe than the Late Frasnian Crisis. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) event may be recognized in various facies areas in South China. In the pelagic cherty basin facies, both Lower and Upper Kellwasser events can seemingly be recognized. In the deeper water carbonate facies, the F-F event level is well controlled in light of conodont biostratigraphy. In the shallow water carbonate and mixed carbonate-shale facies, the F-F boundary may be defined by clear taxonomic distinction in benthic fossils (articulate brachiopods and corals) as well as evidence from minor pelagic fossils. Post-extinction recovery rate of benthic organisms differs in different facies settings and different taxonomic groups. In open shallow water platform to inter-platform depression areas, brachiopods seem to recover quickly, probably in the Middle Pa. triangularis Zone; benthic ostracodes seem to recover at a later stage; recovery of rugose corals did not happen until the uppermost Famennian. Three steps of the F-F mass extinction are postulated: 1) extinction of diverse brachiopods (including most atrypids); 2) extinction of pelagic conodonts; 3) extinction of both benthic faunas (very abundant and diverse rugose corals and ostracodes) and pelagic conodonts. Evidence of an end-Frasnian regression in South China is clear, particularly in shallow water settings. However, in deeper water settings, the picture is complicated, with evidence of both sea level rise and fall in the latest Frasnian. It may be assumed from overall data so far known that crustal evolution itself and associated multiple volcanic/hydrothermal activities may have mainly caused frequent and rapid climatically warming-cooling alterations and sea level changes as well as marine ecologic collapse (eutrophication, microbial blooming, seawater acidification, and anoxia), which may explain the F-F extinction pattern in South China.},

abstract = {The cause of the Frasnian-Famennian boundary (FFB) biotic crisis, one of the "Big Five" Phanerozoic mass extinctions, remains poorly understood. Here, we generated a high-resolution uranium-isotope profile ($\delta$238U) for a marine carbonate section at Baisha, South China, in order to document secular variation in mean global-ocean redox conditions and to compare its relationship to coeval changes in organic carbon burial fluxes (as proxied by $\delta$13Ccarb) and global climate conditions. $\delta$238U varied in a coordinated, mostly positive relationship with $\delta$13Ccarb, indicating that expanded (reduced) oceanic anoxia was linked to lower (higher) productivity. This pattern is inconsistent with productivity control of redox conditions and suggests instead that both proxies responded to a common climatic forcing. We infer that climatic cooling (and glaciation during the Upper Kellwasser Horizon [UKH] event) led to better-ventilated oceanic conditions (higher $\delta$238U) and greater productivity (higher $\delta$13Ccarb) owing to invigoration of globalocean overturning circulation and enhanced upwelling. Because the UKH event coincided with the FFB mass extinction, cooling rather than oceanic anoxia may have been the main killing mechanism.},

abstract = {Anomalously high rates of continental weathering have frequently been proposed as a key stimulus for the development of widespread marine anoxia during a number of Late Devonian environmental and biospheric crises, which included a major mass extinction during the Frasnian–Famennian transition (marked by the Upper and Lower Kellwasser horizons). Here, this model is investigated by presenting the first stratigraphic record of osmium-isotope trends ( 187 Os/ 188 Os) in upper Devonian strata from the Kowala Quarry (Holy Cross Mountains, Poland). Changes in reconstructed 187 Os/ 188 Os seawater values to more radiogenic compositions are documented at the base of both the Lower ($\sim$0.42 to $\sim$0.83) and Upper ($\sim$0.31 to $\sim$0.81) Kellwasser horizons characteristic of the Frasnian–Famennian transition, and additionally within upper Famennian shales that record a more minor environmental perturbation known as the Annulata Event ($\sim$0.20 to $\sim$0.53). These shifts indicate the occurrence of extremely enhanced continental weathering rates at the onsets of the Kellwasser crises and during the later Annulata Event. The similarity of 187 Os/ 188 Os values in this study from Frasnian–Famennian boundary and lower Famennian strata (between 0.4 and 0.5) to those from North American stratigraphic equivalents suggests that the 187 Os/ 188 Os values record global trends. These findings support a causal relationship between increased continental weathering (and thus, nutrient supply to the marine shelf) and the environmental perturbations that occurred during numerous Late Devonian events, including both of the biospherically catastrophic Kellwasser crises as well as other, less severe, oceanic anoxic events.},

abstract = {The appearance of terrestrial land plants is thought to have accompanied an increase in atmospheric oxygen levels, producing the highest O2 concentrations estimated from the geological record, and marking the transition to a permanently oxygenated deep ocean. This Paleozoic oxygenation event, which likely peaked in the Carboniferous Period, was at least partially mediated by the development of recalcitrant, carbon-rich organic compounds in terrestrial plants. A number of studies have argued that shifts in coal formation and paleogeography led to declining preservation of these compounds on land, depressing oxygen levels in the terminal Paleozoic and early Mesozoic. In contrast, we propose that the evolution and diversification of terrestrial herbivores may have limited transport and long-term burial of terrestrial organic compounds in marine sediments, resulting in less organic carbon burial and attendant declines in atmospheric oxygen. This mechanism suggests that interactions among a triad of biological processes—marine photosynthesis, land plant colonization, and the advent of herbivory—may have dictated the long-term redox state of Earth's surface environments over the Phanerozoic Eon.},

abstract = {Johnson et al. (Johnson, J.G., Klapper, G., Sandberg, C.A., 1985. Devonian eustatic fluctuations in Euramerica. Geological Society of America Bulletin 96, 567-587) proposed one of the first explicit links between marine anoxia, transgression and mass extinction for the Frasnian-Famennian (F-F, Late Devonian) mass extinction. This cause-and-effect nexus has been accepted by many but others prefer sea-level fall and cooling as an extinction mechanism. New facies analysis of sections in the USA and Europe (France, Germany, Poland), and comparison with sections known from the literature in Canada, Australia and China reveal several high-frequency relative sea-level changes in the late Frasnian to earliest Famennian extinction interval. A clear signal of major transgression is seen within the Early rhenana Zone (e.g. drowning of the carbonate platform in the western United States). This is the base of transgressive-regressive Cycle IId of the Johnson et al. (Johnson, J.G., Klapper, G., Sandberg, C.A., 1985. Devonian eustatic fluctuations in Euramerica. Geological Society of America Bulletin 96, 567-587) eustatic curve. This was curtailed by regression and sequence boundary generation within the early linguiformis Zone, recorded by hardground and karstification surfaces in sections from Canada to Australia. This major eustatic fall probably terminated platform carbonate deposition over wide areas, especially in western North America. The subsequent transgression in the later linguiformis Zone, recorded by the widespread development of organic-rich shale facies, is also significant because it is associated with the expansion of anoxic deposition, known as the Upper Kellwasser Event. Johnson et al.'s (Johnson, J.G., Klapper, G., Sandberg, C.A., 1985. Devonian eustatic fluctuations in Euramerica. Geological Society of America Bulletin 96, 567-587) original transgression-anoxia-extinction link is thus supported, although some extinction losses of platform carbonate biota during the preceeding regression cannot be ruled out. Conodont faunas suffered major losses during the Upper Kellwasser Event, with deep-water taxa notably affected. This renders unreliable any eustatic analyses utilising changes in conodont biofacies. Claims for a latest Frasnian regression are not supported, and probably reflect poor biostratigraphic dating of the early linguiformis Zone sequence boundary. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Early Triassic is generally portrayed as a time of various, high ecological stresses leading to a delayed biotic recovery after the devastating end-Permian mass extinction. This interval is notably characterized by repeated biotic crises (e.g., during the late Smithian), large-scale fluctuations of the global carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycles as well as harsh marine conditions including a combination of ocean acidification, anoxia, extreme seawater temperatures and shifting productivity. Observations from different paleolatitudes suggest that sulfidic (H2S-rich) conditions may have developed widely during the Early Triassic, possibly reaching up to ultra-shallow environments in some places. However, the existence and the spatio-temporal extent of such redox swings remain poorly constrained. In order to explore Early Triassic paleoceanographic redox changes and their potential influences on the biotic recovery, we analyzed multiple sulfur isotopes (32S, 33S, 34S, and 36S) of sedimentary pyrite and carbonate associated sulfate ($\delta$34SCAS) from the Mineral Mountains section, Utah. Sediments from this section were mainly deposited in shallow waters and span the Smithian and lower Spathian. We report a 68‰ range of variations in $\delta$34Spy associated with $\Delta$33Spy varying from −0.01‰ to +0.12‰, whereas the $\delta$34SCAS varies between +19.5‰ and + 34.8‰. We interpret the observed signal of multiple sulfur isotopes as reflecting the operation of pore-water synsedimentary microbial sulfate reduction in open system with respect to sulfates before the late Smithian, evolving to a closed system, sulfate limited, Rayleigh-type distillation across the Smithian/Spathian boundary (SSB) and immediately after the SSB. We argue that this marked change is driven by the effectiveness of the connection between the sedimentary pore waters and the overlying water column, which is, in this case, controlled by the local sedimentological conditions such as the bioturbation intensity and the sedimentation rate. Therefore, our results suggest that changes in the sulfur cycle before and across the SSB at Mineral Mountains is probably a local consequence of the loss of the mixed sedimentary layer during the late Smithian extinction event, as opposed to reflecting the development of a lethal anoxic ocean at the global scale.},

abstract = {Early Triassic marine ecosystems experienced multiple environmental perturbations and a delayed biotic recovery following the end-Permian mass extinction. The Smithian–Spathian boundary (SSB), in the late Early Triassic, marks a major shift toward a less intensely warm climate, ameliorated marine environmental conditions, and the onset of a more sustained recovery of marine faunas. Accumulating geochemical evidence indicates that these developments were accompanied by large changes in global-ocean circulation during the Smithian–Spathian (S–S) transition. In the present study, tandem carbon and sulfur isotopic records were used to investigate changes in the marine carbon and sulfur cycles across the SSB and their potential relationship to global-ocean circulation changes. First, we conducted a carbon‑sulfur isotope study at two deepwater SSB sections (West Pingdingshan and Jiarong) in South China. High-resolution $\delta$13Ccarb-$\delta$34SCAS profiles show large positive excursions and strong correlations through the S–S transition, suggesting control by co-burial of organic matter and pyrite. Second, we reviewed global carbon‑sulfur isotope studies through the Smithian and Spathian substages. Similar to carbonate carbon isotopes, sulfate sulfur isotopes also show vertical gradient changes during the S–S transition. We link these changes to an expansion of oceanic oxygen-minimum zones (OMZs) in response to a cooling-driven re-invigoration of global-ocean circulation that triggered enhanced productivity on platform margins. OMZ expansion may have contributed to a second-order extinction among conodonts and ammonoids at the SSB, but the long-term shift toward more vigorous ocean circulation and better-ventilated watermasses is likely to have facilitated the overall recovery of marine biotas during the Spathian Substage of the late Early Triassic.},

abstract = {The Late Devonian was marked by repeated faunal crises and episodes of geographically widespread marine anoxia, and featured one of the ‘Big Five' mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic Aeon during the Frasnian–Famennian transition. However, the processes responsible for causing the numerous anoxic events remain unclear. This study highlights the occurrence of disturbances to the phosphorus cycle during several Late Devonian crises by investigating sedimentary concentrations of the element (Ptot) as a tracer of nutrient influx, as well as its ratio with total organic carbon (TOC) to infer the recycling of the element from marine sediments. Increased TOC/Ptot ratios in the Frasnian–Famennian Lower and Upper Kellwasser horizons and upper Famennian Annulata and Hangenberg levels suggest that such nutrient recycling occurred across extensive areas of the marine shelf in Laurentia and both Rheic Ocean margins at those times, helping to sustain reducing conditions in those environments. Elevated Ptot values in the Upper Kellwasser, Annulata, and Hangenberg levels are consistent with an enhanced nutrient influx as the initial trigger for the anoxia. Correlation of phosphorus trends with other geochemical indicators of weathering/detrital influx (osmium-isotope, silicon/aluminum, and titanium/aluminium ratios) support a scenario in which terrestrial runoff provided these nutrients both to marine shelves and the oceanic inventory. Upwelling of oceanic deep-water bodies may have then brought the phosphorus to areas that had not featured major direct inputs of terrigenous material. The exception is the Lower Kellwasser Event, during which there was no increase in phosphorus delivery to marine areas and no evidence for terrestrial influx at the studied sections, invoking a different mechanism for the development of water-column anoxia. Clearly, the Late Devonian marine realm was unusually susceptible to becoming anoxic through various possible triggers, including nutrient influx from land and/or deep-water upwelling, and the recycling of phosphorus from newly deposited sediments.},

abstract = {Explaining the ∼5-million-year delay in marine biotic recovery following the latest Permian mass extinction, the largest biotic crisis of the Phanerozoic, is a fundamental challenge for both geological and biological sciences. Ocean redox perturbations may have played a critical role in this delayed recovery. However, the lack of quantitative constraints on the details of Early Triassic oceanic anoxia (for example, time, duration, and extent) leaves the links between oceanic conditions and the delayed biotic recovery ambiguous. We report high-resolution U-isotope ($\delta$238U) data from carbonates of the uppermost Permian to lowermost Middle Triassic Zal section (Iran) to characterize the timing and global extent of ocean redox variation during the Early Triassic. Our $\delta$238U record reveals multiple negative shifts during the Early Triassic. Isotope mass-balance modeling suggests that the global area of anoxic seafloor expanded substantially in the Early Triassic, peaking during the latest Permian to mid-Griesbachian, the late Griesbachian to mid-Dienerian, the Smithian-Spathian transition, and the Early/Middle Triassic transition. Comparisons of the U-, C-, and Sr-isotope records with a modeled seawater PO43- concentration curve for the Early Triassic suggest that elevated marine productivity and enhanced oceanic stratification were likely the immediate causes of expanded oceanic anoxia. The patterns of redox variation documented by the U-isotope record show a good first-order correspondence to peaks in ammonoid extinctions during the Early Triassic. Our results indicate that multiple oscillations in oceanic anoxia modulated the recovery of marine ecosystems following the latest Permian mass extinction.},

Here we use paired records of uranium concentrations ([U]) and 238U/235U isotopic compositions ($\delta$238U) of Upper Permian-Upper Triassic marine limestones from China and Turkey to quantify variations in global seafloor redox conditions. We observe abrupt decreases in [U] and $\delta$238U across the end-Permian extinction horizon, from ∼3 ppm and -0.15‰ to ∼0.3 ppm and -0.77‰, followed by a gradual return to preextinction values over the subsequent 5 million years. These trends imply a factor of 100 increase in the extent of seafloor anoxia and suggest the presence of a shallow oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) that inhibited the recovery of benthic animal diversity and marine ecosystem function. We hypothesize that in the Early Triassic oceans - characterized by prolonged shallow anoxia that may have impinged onto continental shelves - global biogeochemical cycles and marine ecosystem structure became more sensitive to variation in the position of the OMZ. Under this hypothesis, the Middle Triassic decline in bottom water anoxia, stabilization of biogeochemical cycles, and diversification of marine animals together reflect the development of a deeper and less extensive OMZ, which regulated Earth system recovery following the end-Permian catastrophe.},

abstract = {Conodonts, microfossils composed of carbonate-fluor apatite, are abundant in Palaeozoic-Triassic sediments and have a high potential to preserve primary oxygen isotope signals. In order to reconstruct the palaeotemperature history of the Devonian, the oxygen isotope composition of apatite phosphate was measured on 639 conodont samples from sequences in Europe, North America and Australia. The Early Devonian (Lochkovian; 416-411 Myr) was characterized by warm tropical temperatures of around 30 °C. A cooling trend started in the Pragian (410 Myr) with intermediate temperatures around 23 to 25 °C reconstructed for the Middle Devonian (397-385 Myr). During the Frasnian (383-375 Myr), temperatures increased again with temperatures to 30 °C calculated for the Frasnian-Famennian transition (375 Myr). During the Famennian (375-359 Myr), surface water temperatures slightly decreased. Reconstructed Devonian palaeotemperatures do not support earlier views suggesting the Middle Devonian was a supergreenhouse interval, an interpretation based partly on the development of extensive tropical coral-stromatoporoid communities during the Middle Devonian. Instead, the Devonian palaeotemperature record suggests that Middle Devonian coral-stromatoporoid reefs flourished during cooler time intervals whereas microbial reefs dominated during the warm to very warm Early and Late Devonian. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Organic geochemical analyses of a 380 Ma invertebrate fossil, which included well-preserved soft tissues, from the Gogo Formation (Canning Basin, Western Australia) showed biomarkers and stable isotopic values characteristic of PZE and a consortium of sulfate-reducing bacteria, which lead to exceptional fossil and biomarker preservation. The carbonate concretion contained phytoplankton, green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobi), and sulfate-reducing bacteria biomarkers with an increasing concentration toward the nucleus where the fossil is preserved. The spatial distribution of cholestane unequivocally associated with the fossilized tissue and its high relative abundance to the total steranes suggest that the fossil is a crustacean. The presence of an active sulfur cycle in this Devonian system, including sulfate reduction and the resulting PZE, played a pivotal role in the preservation of soft tissue from the fossil and its associated low-maturity biomarker ratios. {\textcopyright} 2012 Geological Society of America.},

In order to recognize the Kellwasser events and to evaluate their influences on the deep-water ecosystems, a newly refined conodont biostratigraphic framework spanning the Lower Palmatolepis rhenana Zone to the Pa. delicatula platys Zone has been established in the Nandong section (basinal facies), Guangxi, South China. The Upper Devonian Lower and Upper Kellwasser horizons (LKH and UKH) have been recognized in the deep-water facies on the basis of lithological variations, biological turnovers, and positive carbon isotope ($\delta$13Ccarb) excursions. The LKH is characterized by the enrichment of marine nektonic communities (e.g. conodonts, homoctenids, and entomozoacean ostracods), whereas the top of the UKH is barren of fossil organisms, suggesting that the Upper Kellwasser event had a more severe effect on nekton than the Lower Kellwasser event. The Upper Kellwasser (UK) $\delta$13Ccarb positive excursion lags behind the enrichment of Cu, Ni, Mo and V, indicating that the UK $\delta$13Ccarb positive excursion was probably related to elevated primary productivity, which induced oxygen depletion in the water column. The UK $\delta$13Ccarb positive excursion peak prior to the F–F boundary indicates a more limited effect of riverine influx on the deep-water setting, which suggests that the regional palaeogeographic configuration played an important role in the carbon cycle.},

The GEOCARBSULF model utilizes carbon and sulphur isotope records to produce the most detailed history of Phanerozoic atmospheric O2 currently available. However, its predictions for the Paleozoic disagree with geochemical proxies, and with non-isotope modelling. Here we show that GEOCARBSULF oversimplifies the geochemistry of sulphur isotope fractionation, returning unrealistic values for the O2 sourced from pyrite burial when oxygen is low. We rebuild the model from first principles, utilizing an improved numerical scheme, the latest carbon isotope data, and we replace the sulphur cycle equations in line with forwards modelling approaches. Our new model, GEOCARBSULFOR, produces a revised, highly-detailed prediction for Phanerozoic O2 that is consistent with available proxy data, and independently supports a Paleozoic Oxygenation Event, which likely contributed to the observed radiation of complex, diverse fauna at this time.},

In this study, geochemical evidence in the Late Devonian Antrim Shale, Michigan Basin, U.S.A., records episodic euxinia contemporaneous with these extinction events. Diagnostic changes in iron proxy data and elevated trace metal enrichments correspond to the Kellwasser Crisis. In this study, carbon, sulfur, iron and trace metal geochemistry preserved in the Antrim Formation validates the establishment and expansion of euxinic conditions associated with the Kellwasser Crisis and the Frasnian-Famennian boundary. The strength of the sequential extraction iron mineral data presented here, in concert with trace metal and sulfur isotope proxies, provides definitive signatures of euxinia when other data may be more ambiguous in regard to paleoredox conditions. During the time of the Frasnian-Famennian boundary extensive sulfide oxidation at the chemocline, the result of Fe-limiting conditions within the basin, provides an alternative explanation for the oceanic decline in $\delta$34SSO4 during, and following, the Frasnian-Famennian event. Our geochemical evidence, indicating the presence of anoxia in the Michigan Basin, is consistent with data from other globally distributed locations. Euxinia should be considered a key driver for these global extinction events, and possibly others such as the Hangenberg Event in the Late Devonian.},

We found the most negative carbonate d238U values yet reported (−0.95 per mil), which were reproduced in two widely spaced coeval sections spanning the terminal Ediacaran Period (551 to 541 million years ago). Mass balance modeling indicates an episode of extensive oceanic anoxia, during which anoxia covered >21% of the seafloor and most U entering the oceans was removed into sediments below anoxic waters. The results suggest that an expansion of oceanic anoxia and temporal-spatial redox heterogeneity, independent of other environmental and ecological factors, may have contributed to the decline of the Ediacara biota and may have also stimulated animal motility.},

abstract = {The decline in dissolved oxygen in global oceans (ocean deoxygenation) is a potential consequence of global warming which may have important impacts on ocean biogeochemistry and marine ecosystems. Current climate models do not agree on the trajectory of future deoxygenation on different timescales, in part due to uncertainties in the complex, linked effects of changes in ocean circulation, productivity and organic matter respiration. More (semi-)quantitative reconstructions of oceanic oxygen levels over the Pleistocene glacial cycles may provide a critical test of our mechanistic understanding of the response of oceanic oxygenation to climate change. Even the most promising proxies for bottom water oxygen (BWO) have limitations, which calls for new proxy development and a multi-proxy compilation to evaluate glacial ocean oxygenation. We use Holocene benthic foraminifera to explore I/Ca in Cibicidoides spp. as a BWO proxy. We propose that low I/Ca (e.g., <3 $\mu$mol/mol) in conjunction with benthic foraminiferal carbon isotope gradients and/or the surface pore area percentages in foraminiferal tests (e.g., >15%) may provide semi-quantitative estimates of low BWO in past oceans (e.g., <∼50 $\mu$mol/kg). We present I/Ca records in five cores and a global compilation of multiproxy data, indicating that bottom waters were generally less-oxygenated during glacial periods, with low O2 waters (<∼50 $\mu$mol/kg) occupying some parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Water mass ventilation and circulation may have been important in deoxygenation of the glacial deep Pacific and South Atlantic, whereas enhanced remineralization of organic matter may have had a greater impact on reducing the oxygen content of the interior Atlantic Ocean.},

abstract = {Stratigraphic variability in the geochemistry of sedimentary rocks provides critical data for interpreting paleoenvironmental change throughout Earth history. However, the vast majority of pre-Jurassic geochemical records derive from shallow-water carbonate platforms that may not reflect global ocean chemistry. Here, we used calcium isotope ratios ($\delta$44Ca) in conjunction with minor-element geochemistry (Sr/Ca) and field observations to explore the links among sea-level change, carbonate mineralogy, and marine diagenesis and the expression of a globally documented interval of elevated carbon isotope ratios ($\delta$13C; Hirnantian isotopic carbon excursion [HICE]) associated with glaciation in Upper Ordovician shallowwater carbonate strata from Anticosti Island, Canada, and the Great Basin, Nevada and Utah, USA. The HICE on Anticosti is preserved in limestones with low $\delta$44Ca and high Sr/Ca, consistent with aragonite as a major component of primary mineralogy. Great Basin strata are characterized by lateral gradients in $\delta$44Ca and $\delta$13C that reflect variations in the extent of early marine diagenesis across the platform. In deep-ramp settings, deposition during synglacial sea-level lowstand and subsequent postglacial flooding increased the preservation of an aragonitic signature with elevated $\delta$13C produced in shallow-water environments. In contrast, on the mid-and inner ramp, extensive early marine diagenesis under seawaterbuffered conditions muted the magnitude of the shift in $\delta$13C. The processes documented here provide an alternative explanation for variability in a range of geochemical proxies preserved in shallow-water carbonates at other times in Earth history, and challenge the notion that these proxies necessarily record changes in the global ocean.},

abstract = {A new, biogeochemical model of ice age cycles is developed and applied which explains major features of climate variations in the late Quaternary -rapid ice age terminations, large glacial-interglacial amplitudes and ∼ 100-kyr cycles - in a way consistent with the paleorecord. Existing models which invoke non-linear, ice-sheet-earth-crust dynamics to explain ice age cycles are not consistent with simultaneous terminations in both hemispheres and other phase relationships implied by the paleorecord. The present model relates climate change to oscillations of oceanic primary (new) production controlled by the availability of inorganic nitrogen. Large oscillations follow shelf erosion events triggered by small sea-level drops. These drops are due to glacial buildup associated with a minimum in Northern Hemisphere insolation. Rapid global warming at terminations is initiated by open ocean denitrification events leading to new production crashes and rapid modification of atmospheric trace gas concentrations (CO2, DMS, N2O). Other feedbacks of the land-ice-atmosphere-ocean system control the rest of the climate cycle. 100-kyr cycles derive from orbital pacemaking of the strong, low-frequency model response. Results suggest that the climate regime transition near 800 kyr B.P. may be related to changes in the continental shelf slope, that existing chronologies based on orbital tuning may need to be revised and that temporary increases in atmospheric N2O concentrations at terminations, due to the denitrification events, may have caused significant "greenhouse" warming. A "spike" of elevated N2O concentration at terminations may be recorded in polar ice. {\textcopyright} 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {It has long been recognized that the advent of vascular plants in the Paleozoic must have changed silicate weathering and fundamentally altered the long-term carbon cycle. Carbon cycle models are frequently employed to quantify the effect of this state change in the Earth system. These models have suggested that plants likely played a key role in modulating atmospheric CO 2 in the past, with the largest plant-induced changes to the system in the late Paleozoic. These studies have, for the most part, focused on the effects of plants on weathering via their impacts on the soil environment. Yet, plants also modify the hydrological cycle, which may also have had implications for global weathering. Here, we evaluate the consequences of plant evolutionary innovation that have not been previously incorporated into carbon cycle models by coupling a one-dimensional vapor transport model to a reactive transport model of silicate weathering. Using this cascade of models, we investigate: 1) how evolutionary shifts in plant transpiration may have enhanced silicate weathering through increased downwind transport of water vapor to continental interiors; 2) the importance of deeply-rooted plants and their associated microbial communities in increasing soil CO 2 and weathering zone length scales; and, 3) the coupled effect of these two processes on weathering rates. The hydrologic balance for our modeling approach is framed by energy/supply constraints (encapsulated through Budyko relationships) calibrated for minimally vegetated-, vascular plant forested-, and angiosperm-worlds. Using constraints for atmospheric vapor-transport over continents and terrestrial weathering fluxes, we find that the emergence of widespread transpiration and associated inland vapor recycling associated with the advent of deep-rooted vascular plants over the later Devonian increases weathering solute concentrations by a factor of 1.64 to 2.39 for a fixed atmospheric CO 2 . The later domination of ecosystems by angiosperms in the late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, and the subsequent increase in transpiration fluxes, increased weathering solute concentrations by 7 to 55 percent leading to a cumulative total increase in weathering solute concentrations by a factor of 1.70 to 2.55. Partitioning of the vapor recycling effects and feedbacks on the weathering thermodynamics indicates that 55 percent of the increases in weathering concentrations are due to the thermodynamic effects of soil CO 2 with the remaining 45 percent attributable to hydrologic effects. Our estimates of the relative changes in weathering solute concentrations caused by land plant evolution are of a similar magnitude to relative flux scaling relationships implemented in existing carbon cycle models such as GEOCARBSULF (Berner, 2006), COPSE (Bergman and others, 2004), and GEOCLIM (Le Hir and others, 2011). As Phanerozoic plant evolution resulted in a more efficient generation of weathering solutes, a weaker dependence of silicate weathering on physical forcing factors such as temperature, pH of rainwater, tectonics, and prevailing lithology, must have resulted. Consequently, we postulate that terrestrial plant evolution likely contributed to a more stable climate system over the Phanerozoic.},

abstract = {The geological cycling of carbon ties together the ocean-Atmosphere carbon pool, Earth's biosphere, and Earth's sedimentary reservoirs. Perturbations to this coupled system are recorded in the carbon-isotopic ($\delta$13C) composition of marine carbonates. Large amplitude $\delta$13C excursions are typically treated as individual events and interpreted accordingly. However, a recent compilation of Phanerozoic carbon isotopic data reveals that $\delta$13C excursions are a ubiquitous feature of the geologic record, and thus should be considered in concert. Analysis indicates that Phanerozoic carbon isotope excursions, as a whole, have characteristic durations of 0.5 to 10 M.yr. and exhibit declining amplitude over time. These commonalities suggest a shared underlying control. Here we demonstrate that sinusoidal modulation of the sensitivity of organic carbon and phosphate burial in a simple numerical model of the geologic carbon cycle results in large, asymmetric $\delta$13C oscillations that exhibit their largest amplitudes in the 0.5 to 10 M.yr. period range. As anoxia is known to strongly modulate the C:P burial ratio of organic matter in sediments, we propose that sea-level oscillations were the primary source of sinusoidal modulation for the geologic carbon cycle, and that their degree of influence on the carbon cycle was determined by the state of oxygenation of bottom waters overlying the continental shelves. When oxygenminimum zones (OMZs) were large, shallow, and prone to expansion, sea-level changes would have had the capacity to drive large changes in the areal extent of OMZs in contact with the sea-floor, resulting in strong leverage on the burial sensitivity of organic carbon and phosphate, and thus on $\delta$13C. Progressive oxygenation of the oceans, which was facilitated by biological innovations, resulted in a decline in the amplitude of $\delta$13C excursions over the Phanerozoic, and the biogeochemical stabilization of the Earth System.},

The nature and magnitude of the earliest transitions, hundreds of million years before photosynthesis evolved, remain poorly understood. Using a novel ecosystem-planetary model, we find that pre-photosynthetic methane-cycling microbial ecosystems are much less productive than previously thought. In spite of their low productivity, the evolution of methanogenic metabolisms strongly modifies the atmospheric composition, leading to a warmer but less resilient climate. As the abiotic carbon cycle responds, further metabolic evolution (anaerobic methanotrophy) may feed back to the atmosphere and destabilize the climate, triggering a transient global glaciation. Although early metabolic evolution may cause strong climatic instability, a low CO:CH4 atmospheric ratio emerges as a robust signature of simple methane-cycling ecosystems on a globally reduced planet such as the late Hadean/early Archean Earth.},

abstract = {The Paleozoic emergence of terrestrial plants has been linked to a stepwise increase in Earth's O2 levels and a cooling of Earth's climate by drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Vegetation affects the Earth's O2 and CO2 levels in multiple ways, including preferential organic carbon preservation by decay-resistant biopolymers (e.g. lignin) and changing the continental weathering regime that governs oceanic nutrient supply and marine biological production. Over shorter time scales (≤1 Myr), land plant evolution is hypothesized to have occasionally enhanced P weathering and fertilized the oceans, expanding marine anoxia and causing marine extinctions. Oceanic anoxia would eventually become limited by oceanic O2 uptake as oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere and surface oceans when excess organic carbon is buried in marine sediments. Here, we review hypotheses and evidence for how the evolving terrestrial ecosystems impacted atmospheric and oceanic O2 and CO2 from the Ordovician and into the Carboniferous (485–298.9 Ma). Five major ecological stages in the terrestrial realm occurred during the prolonged time interval when land was colonized by plants, animals and fungi, marked by the evolution of 1) non-vascular plants, 2) vascular plants with lignified tissue, 3) plants with shallow roots, 4) arborescent and perennial vegetation with deep and complex root systems, and 5) seed plants. The prediction that land vegetation profoundly impacted the Earth system is justified, although it is still debated how the individual transitions affected the Earth's O2 and CO2 levels. The geological record preserves multiple lines of indirect evidence for environmental transitions that can help us to reconstruct and quantify global controls on Earth's oxygenation and climate state.},

abstract = {Various functions have been suggested and applied to represent the sedimentation and remineralisation of particulate organic matter (POM) in numerical ocean models. Here we investigate some representations commonly used in large-scale biogeochemical models: a constant sinking speed, a sinking speed increasing with depth, a spectrum of particles with different size and different size-dependent sinking velocities, and a model that assumes a power law particle size distribution everywhere in the water column. The analysis is carried out for an idealised one-dimensional water column, under stationary boundary conditions for surface POM. It focuses on the intrinsic assumptions of the respective sedimentation function and their effect on POM mass, mass flux, and remineralisation profiles.A constant and uniform sinking speed does not appear appropriate for simulations exceeding a few decades, as the sedimentation profile is not consistent with observed profiles. A spectrum of size classes, together with size-dependent sinking and constant remineralisation, causes the sinking speed of total POM to increase with depth. This increase is not strictly linear with depth. Its particular form will further depend on the size distribution of the POM ensemble at the surface. Assuming a power law particle size spectrum at the surface, this model results in unimodal size distributions in the ocean interior. For the size-dependent sinking model, we present an analytic integral over depth and size that can explain regional variations of remineralisation length scales in response to regional patterns in trophodynamic state.},

abstract = {For decades, bivalve shells have constituted one of the most common supports for paleoclimatic archives based on stable isotope approaches. In this work, we conducted chemical marking and recapture techniques to study the fluctuation of $\delta$18O values of oyster shells of the species Magallana gigas reared in natural environment in Normandy (France) for two years. The results were compared to the continuous monitoring of temperature and salinity and monthly records of seawater $\delta$18O. Isotopic measurements were performed on the hinge area that regroups the whole life of the oysters. Here we demonstrate that oysters mineralized their shells with no significant growth breaks during the two-years experiment, even at temperatures below 6 °C. The results confirm that adult oysters (i.e. > 1 yr) mineralized their shells at equilibrium. However, juvenile specimens exhibit a strong isotopic disequilibrium, with a maximum shift of the $\delta$18O values of 3‰ in winter, likely due to kinetic isotope effects. This corresponds to a reconstructed temperature up to 13 °C warmer than expected. This work indicates that although these oyster shells can be used as an accurate archive of (paleo)environmental conditions, the shell portion mineralized during the juvenile stage (i.e. < 1 yr) should be avoided for paleotemperature reconstructions. Given the wide use of bivalve shells as environmental archives, similar studies on others species are required.},

abstract = {Sediment accumulation rates and thermal trackers suggest a substantial and global increase in erosion rates over the past few million years. That increase is commonly associated with the impact of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation, but methodological biases have led researchers to debate this hypothesis. Here, we test whether Himalayan erosion rates increased by measuring beryllium-10 (10Be) in the sediment of the Bengal Bay seabed. Sediment originated from rocks that produced 10Be under the impact of cosmic rays during erosion near surface. Thus, the 10Be concentrations indicate erosion rates. The 10Be concentration of the Bengal Bay sediment depends on the contributions of the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers. Their sediments have distinct 10Be concentrations because of distinct elevations and erosion in their drainage basins. Variable contributions could thus complicate erosion-rate calculation. We traced these contributions by a provenance study using the strontium (Sr) and neodymium (Nd) isotopic sediment compositions. Within uncertainties of ±30%, our reconstructed past erosion rates show no long-term increase for the past six million years. This stability suggests that climatic changes during the late Cenozoic have an undetectable impact on the erosion patterns in the Himalayas, at least on the ten thousand to million year timescales accounted for by our dataset.},

abstract = {Earth's penultimate icehouse, the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA), was a time of dynamic glaciation and repeated ecosystem perturbation, under conditions of substantial variability in atmospheric pCO2 and O2. Improved constraints on the evolution of atmospheric pCO2 and O2 : CO2 during the LPIA and its subsequent demise to permanent greenhouse conditions is crucial for better understanding the nature of linkages between atmospheric composition, climate, and ecosystem perturbation during this time. We present a new and age-recalibrated pCO2 reconstruction for a 40-Myr interval ($\sim$313 to 273 Ma) of the late Paleozoic that (1) confirms a previously hypothesized strong CO2-glaciation linkage, (2) documents synchroneity between major pCO2 and O2 : CO2 changes and compositional turnovers in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, (3) lends support for a modeled progressive decrease in the CO2 threshold for initiation of continental ice sheets during the LPIA, and (4) indicates a likely role of CO2 and O2 : CO2 thresholds in floral ecologic turnovers. Modeling of the relative role of CO2 sinks and sources, active during the LPIA and its demise, on steady-state pCO2 using an intermediate complexity climate-C cycle model (GEOCLIM) and comparison to the new multi-proxy CO2 record provides new insight into the relative influences of the uplift of the Central Pangaean Mountains, intensifying aridification, and increasing mafic rock to-granite rock ratio of outcropping rocks on the global efficiency of CO2 consumption and secular change in steady-state pCO2 through the late Paleozoic.},

abstract = {The impact of climate change on biodiversity has been the focus of studies on the Phanerozoic biotic crises. However, it is still controversial whether climate change has caused the Frasnian–Famennian (F–F) biotic crisis since there is no unequivocal view on the global climate change during this critical period. In order to reconstruct palaeotemperatures during the F–F transition in South China (eastern Palaeotethys), a high-resolution oxygen isotope ($\delta$18OPO4) record was obtained based on 104 measurements of conodont apatite from the Yangdi section. The oxygen isotope record based on mono-generic samples reveals an increase in $\delta$18OPO4 by 0.7‰ in the Lower Kellwasser horizon (LKH) and 1.4‰ in the Upper Kellwasser horizon (UKH), translating into low-latitude surface water cooling of ∼3 °C and ∼6 °C, respectively. These two $\delta$18OPO4 shifts agree well with the time-equivalent $\delta$18OPO4 records from the western Palaeotethys, suggesting that two climate cooling pulses in conjunction with the deposition of the Kellwasser horizons are a global signal during the F–F transition. The positive shift of $\delta$18OPO4 coincides with positive excursion in carbon isotope of carbonates ($\delta$13Ccarb) in the UKH, indicating that enhanced burial of organic carbon resulted in a drop in atmospheric pCO2 and thus global climate cooling. Cooling started immediately before the Upper Kellwasser biotic crisis, with the lowest temperature documented at the top of the UKH. Climate cooling during the deposition of the LKH is observed in conjunction with the sharp decline in metazoan reefs. The coincidence of cooling and the Kellwasser biotic crisis suggests that global cooling played a major role in the collapse of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Million year-scale (3rd-order) depositional sequences (few 10s to $\sim$ 100 m-thick) are common in the Devonian marine record and are correlated between sedimentary basins and across widely separated continents implying a eustatic origin. Tectonically driven changes in mid-ocean ridge spreading rates/lengths are too slow to account for the calculated 3rd-order rise/fall rates and typical orbital frequencies ($\sim$ 20-400 ky) are too fast. We analyzed oxygen isotopes from conodont apatite to evaluate if Early-Middle Devonian 3rd-order sea-level changes were controlled by paleoclimatically driven ice volume (glacio-eustasy) and seawater temperature change (thermo-eustasy). Two successive depositional sequences in the western U.S. (Nevada) and Czech Republic (Prague Basin) were sampled. The $\delta$18O values range from 17.8‰ to 20.2‰ (SMOW) and show similar trends across the Emsian-Eifelian boundary with increasing and peak values in the lower costatus, decreasing values in the mid costatus, and increasing values in the upper costatus to australis zones. The similarities between these widely separated localities indicate that the isotopic trends are global rather than controlled by local variations in seawater temperature, evaporation/freshwater influx, or diagenesis. In the Nevada section, where the sea-level history is the most complete and best understood, the isotopic values increase and peak in late highstand and lowstand system tracts and decrease to the lowest values in the transgressive and maximum flooding intervals suggesting the My-scale sea-level changes were paleoclimatically controlled. The magnitude of isotopic shift from lowstand to maximum flooding intervals ranges from 0.8‰ to 1.5‰ and occurred over time spans of < 1.7 My. The only known mechanism to explain such large and rapid isotopic shifts is glacio-eustasy. If a reasonable range of My-scale subtropical sea surface temperature changes are assumed ($\sim$ 1-3 °C), then this requires glacio-eustatic sea-level changes of > 35 m to explain the remaining isotopic shifts. These amplitudes imply that significant continental ice sheets grew and melted on the < 1.7 My time scales during the Early-Middle Devonian and, like recent reports for the mid-Cretaceous and early Eocene, challenge previous assumptions of ice-free greenhouse climates. A plausible climate driver for these My-scale paleoclimate changes is long-period eccentricity ($\sim$ 2.4 My) and obliquity ($\sim$ 1.2 My) variations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Conodonts, microfossils composed of carbonate-fluor apatite, are abundant in Palaeozoic-Triassic sediments and have a high potential to preserve primary oxygen isotope signals. In order to reconstruct the palaeotemperature history of the Devonian, the oxygen isotope composition of apatite phosphate was measured on 639 conodont samples from sequences in Europe, North America and Australia. The Early Devonian (Lochkovian; 416-411 Myr) was characterized by warm tropical temperatures of around 30 °C. A cooling trend started in the Pragian (410 Myr) with intermediate temperatures around 23 to 25 °C reconstructed for the Middle Devonian (397-385 Myr). During the Frasnian (383-375 Myr), temperatures increased again with temperatures to 30 °C calculated for the Frasnian-Famennian transition (375 Myr). During the Famennian (375-359 Myr), surface water temperatures slightly decreased. Reconstructed Devonian palaeotemperatures do not support earlier views suggesting the Middle Devonian was a supergreenhouse interval, an interpretation based partly on the development of extensive tropical coral-stromatoporoid communities during the Middle Devonian. Instead, the Devonian palaeotemperature record suggests that Middle Devonian coral-stromatoporoid reefs flourished during cooler time intervals whereas microbial reefs dominated during the warm to very warm Early and Late Devonian. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The appearance of terrestrial land plants is thought to have accompanied an increase in atmospheric oxygen levels, producing the highest O2 concentrations estimated from the geological record, and marking the transition to a permanently oxygenated deep ocean. This Paleozoic oxygenation event, which likely peaked in the Carboniferous Period, was at least partially mediated by the development of recalcitrant, carbon-rich organic compounds in terrestrial plants. A number of studies have argued that shifts in coal formation and paleogeography led to declining preservation of these compounds on land, depressing oxygen levels in the terminal Paleozoic and early Mesozoic. In contrast, we propose that the evolution and diversification of terrestrial herbivores may have limited transport and long-term burial of terrestrial organic compounds in marine sediments, resulting in less organic carbon burial and attendant declines in atmospheric oxygen. This mechanism suggests that interactions among a triad of biological processes—marine photosynthesis, land plant colonization, and the advent of herbivory—may have dictated the long-term redox state of Earth's surface environments over the Phanerozoic Eon.},

abstract = {The upper Cenomanian - lower Turonian is a key-stratigraphic interval, as it encompasses the Late Cretaceous supergreenhouse and a major perturbation of the global carbon cycle (i. e., Oceanic Anoxic Event 2) as evidenced by a global positive carbon isotope excursion and by the nearly world-wide deposition of organic-rich marine facies. A turnover in planktonic foraminiferal assemblages and in other marine organisms is documented across this stratigraphic interval, but reconstruction of the timing and identification of the cause and effect relationships between environmental perturbations and organism response require a highly- resolved stratigraphic framework. The appearance and extinction levels of planktonic foraminiferal species generally allow accurate intra- and supra-basinal correlations. However, bioevents cannot be assumed to be globally synchronous, because the stratigraphic and geographic distribution of species is modulated by ecological preferences exhibited by each taxon and controlled by oceanic circulation, often resulting in earlier or delayed events in certain geographic areas (i. e., diachronous datums). The aim of this study is to test the synchronicity of the planktonic foraminiferal bioevents recognized across the C/T boundary and to provide the most reliable sequence of events for correlation of low to mid-latitude localities. For this purpose, we have compiled a highly-resolved biostratigraphic analysis of the European reference section for the C/T boundary at Eastbourne, Gun Gardens (UK), and core S57 (Tarfaya, Morocco), and correlated the sequence of bioevents identified with those recorded in other coeval sections available in the literature, including the GSSP section for the base of the Turonian Stage at Rock Canyon, Pueblo (Colorado), where we calculated reliable estimates of planktonic foraminiferal events that are well-constrained by radioisotopically and astrochronologically dated bentonite layers. Results indicate that the extinctions of Thalmanninella deeckei, Thalmanninella greenhornensis, Rotalipora cushmani and "Globigerinelloides" bentonensis in the latest Cenomanian are reliable bioevents for correlation. In addition, our analysis highlights other promising lowest occurrences (LOs) that need to be better constrained by bio- and chemostratigraphy, including the LO of Marginotruncana schneegansi falling close to the C/T boundary. By contrast, the appearance of Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica and of some Dicarinella species, the extinction of anaticinellids and the onset of the "Heterohelix" shift are likely diachronous across low to mid-latitude localities. Finally, our study suggests that different species concepts among authors, different sample size and sampling resolution, as well as species paleoecology are important factors that control the stratigraphic position at which bioevents are identified.},

abstract = {The existence of stabilizing feedbacks within Earth's climate system is generally thought to be necessary for the persistence of liquid water and life. Over the course of Earth's history, Earth's atmospheric composition appears to have adjusted to the gradual increase in solar luminosity, resulting in persistently habitable surface temperatures. With limited exceptions, the Earth system has been observed to recover rapidly from pulsed climatic perturbations. Carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation via negative feedbacks within the coupled global carbon‐silica cycles are classically viewed as the main processes giving rise to climate stability on Earth. Here we review the long‐term global carbon cycle budget, and how the processes modulating Earth's climate system have evolved over time. Specifically, we focus on the relative roles that shifts in carbon sources and sinks have played in driving long‐term changes in atmospheric pCO2. We make the case that marine processes are an important component of the canonical silicate weathering feedback, and have played a much more important role in pCO2 regulation than traditionally imagined. Notably, geochemical evidence indicate that the weathering of marine sediments and off‐axis basalt alteration act as major carbon sinks. However, this sink was potentially dampened during Earth's early history when oceans had higher levels of dissolved silicon (Si), iron (Fe), and magnesium (Mg), and instead likely fostered more extensive carbon recycling within the ocean‐atmosphere system via reverse weathering—that in turn acted to elevate ocean‐atmosphere CO2 levels.},

abstract = {Carbonate oceanic red beds (ORBs) are unusual in Phanerozoic shelf settings but can be widespread during discrete intervals. Several scenarios have been invoked to explain the origin of these ORBs but there remains uncertainty about the process by which the red pigmentation of ORBs forms. Here, we propose that the occurrence of ORBs at intermediate water depths in shelf regions is controlled by fluctuations in the redox state of deeper waters. We have examined Early Triassic Peri-Gondwana shelf sections in South Tibet which show the development of Spathian (late Early Triassic) ORBs at intermediate water depths. The red color of these ORBs is imparted by randomly dispersed hematite crystals that are microns in size, showing weak alteration by late burial diagenesis. Widespread anoxia, in both shelf seas and the oceanic realm, was well developed in the Early Triassic. Synchronous occurrence of Spathian ORBs in deep shelf regions is closely related to the improved oxidation in deeper settings, from anoxia to dysoxia, based on changes in the redox proxy of pyrite framboid sizes. It is, therefore, inferred that prolonged deep-water anoxia might serve as source of Fe (II) for the formation of ORBs when intensified upwelling develops. The global occurrence of Early Triassic ORBs is coincident with the significant rebound of biodiversity after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, indicating the occurrence of ORBs marks the terminal stage of an oceanic anoxic event and ORBs can serve as an indicator of the ameliorated marine ecosystem.},

abstract = {Aim: Poleward migration is a clear response of marine organisms to current global warming but the generality and geographical uniformity of this response are unclear. Marine fossils are expected to record the range shift responses of taxa and ecosystems to past climate change. However, unequal sampling (natural and human) in time and space biases the fossil record, restricting previous studies of ancient migrations to individual taxa and events. We expect that temporal changes in the latitudinal distribution of surviving taxa will reveal range shifts to trace global climate change. Location: Global. Time period: Post-Cambrian Phanerozoic aeon. Major taxa studied: Well-fossilized marine benthic invertebrates comprising stony corals, bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods, trilobites and calcifying sponges. Methods: We track deviations in the latitudinal distribution of range centres of age boundary crossing taxa from the expected distribution, and compare responses across latitudes. We build deviation time series, spanning hundreds of million years, from fossil occurrences and test correlations with seawater temperature estimates derived from stable oxygen isotopes of fossils. Results: Seawater temperature and latitudinal deviations from sampling are positively correlated over the post-Cambrian Phanerozoic. Simulations suggest that sampling patterns are highly unlikely to drive this putative signal of range shifts. Systematically accounting for known sampling issues strengthens this correlation, so that climate is capable of explaining nearly a third of the variance in ancient latitudinal range shifts. The relationship is stronger in low latitude taxa than higher latitude taxa, and in warm ages than cool ages. Main conclusions: Latitudinal range shifts occurred in concert with climate change throughout the post-Cambrian Phanerozoic. Low latitude taxa show the clearest climate-migration signal through time, corroborating predictions of their shift in a warming future.},

abstract = {Multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) applied to sediment trap data has been highly influential in identifying a plausible ballasting mechanism that directly links the settling fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) to those of denser, inorganic minerals. However, analysis to date has primarily been carried out at the global scale, missing spatial variability in the flux relationships that may be important. In this paper, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is applied to an updated deep (>1500 m) sediment trap database (n = 156), using the MLRA approach of Klaas and Archer (2002) but now allowing the carrying coefficients to vary in space. While the global mean carrying coefficient values for CaCO3, opal, and lithogenics are broadly consistent with previous work, the GWR analysis reveals the existence of substantial and statistically significant spatial variability in all three carrying coefficients. In particular, the absence of a strong globally uniform relationship between CaCO3 and POC in our spatial analysis calls into question whether a simple ballasting mechanism exists. Instead, the existence of coherent spatial patterns in carrying coefficients, which are reminiscent of biogeochemical provinces, points toward differences in specific pelagic ecosystem characteristics as being the likely underlying cause of the flux relationships sampled by sediment traps. Our findings present a challenge to ocean carbon cycle modelers who to date have applied a single statistical global relationship in their carbon flux parameterizations when considering mineral ballasting, and provide a further clue as to how the efficiency of the biological pump in the modern ocean is regulated. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {Geological data for the Early Eocene (56-47.8 Ma) indicate extensive global warming, with very warm temperatures at both poles. However, despite numerous attempts to simulate this warmth, there are remarkable data-model differences in the prediction of these polar surface temperatures, resulting in the so-called 'equable climate problem'. In this paper, for the first time an ensemble with a perturbed climate-sensitive model parameters approach has been applied to modelling the Early Eocene climate. We performed more than 100 simulations with perturbed physics parameters, and identified two simulations that have an optimal fit with the proxy data. We have simulated the warmth of the Early Eocene at 560 ppmv CO2, which is a much lower CO2 level than many other models. We investigate the changes in atmospheric circulation, cloud properties and ocean circulation that are common to these simulations and how they differ from the remaining simulations in order to understand what mechanisms contribute to the polar warming. The parameter set from one of the optimal Early Eocene simulations also produces a favourable fit for the last glacial maximum boundary climate and outperforms the control parameter set for the present day. Although this does not 'prove' that this model is correct, it is very encouraging that there is a parameter set that creates a climate model able to simulate well very different palaeoclimates and the present-day climate. Interestingly, to achieve the great warmth of the Early Eocene this version of the model does not have a strong future climate change Charney climate sensitivity. It produces a Charney climate sensitivity of 2.7°C, whereas the mean value of the 18 models in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) is 3.26°C ± 0.69°C. Thus, this value is within the range and below the mean of the models included in the AR4.},

abstract = {The Early Triassic is generally portrayed as a time of various, high ecological stresses leading to a delayed biotic recovery after the devastating end-Permian mass extinction. This interval is notably characterized by repeated biotic crises (e.g., during the late Smithian), large-scale fluctuations of the global carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycles as well as harsh marine conditions including a combination of ocean acidification, anoxia, extreme seawater temperatures and shifting productivity. Observations from different paleolatitudes suggest that sulfidic (H2S-rich) conditions may have developed widely during the Early Triassic, possibly reaching up to ultra-shallow environments in some places. However, the existence and the spatio-temporal extent of such redox swings remain poorly constrained. In order to explore Early Triassic paleoceanographic redox changes and their potential influences on the biotic recovery, we analyzed multiple sulfur isotopes (32S, 33S, 34S, and 36S) of sedimentary pyrite and carbonate associated sulfate ($\delta$34SCAS) from the Mineral Mountains section, Utah. Sediments from this section were mainly deposited in shallow waters and span the Smithian and lower Spathian. We report a 68‰ range of variations in $\delta$34Spy associated with $\Delta$33Spy varying from −0.01‰ to +0.12‰, whereas the $\delta$34SCAS varies between +19.5‰ and + 34.8‰. We interpret the observed signal of multiple sulfur isotopes as reflecting the operation of pore-water synsedimentary microbial sulfate reduction in open system with respect to sulfates before the late Smithian, evolving to a closed system, sulfate limited, Rayleigh-type distillation across the Smithian/Spathian boundary (SSB) and immediately after the SSB. We argue that this marked change is driven by the effectiveness of the connection between the sedimentary pore waters and the overlying water column, which is, in this case, controlled by the local sedimentological conditions such as the bioturbation intensity and the sedimentation rate. Therefore, our results suggest that changes in the sulfur cycle before and across the SSB at Mineral Mountains is probably a local consequence of the loss of the mixed sedimentary layer during the late Smithian extinction event, as opposed to reflecting the development of a lethal anoxic ocean at the global scale.},

abstract = {The Arctic region is thought to play a key role in unraveling Mesozoic climate evolution. However, Late Cretaceous climate reconstructions in the high latitudes suffer from contradicting paleoclimatic interpretations. Toward the end of the Cretaceous hot-house, atmospheric CO2 concentration declined potentially enabling the formation of sea-ice in the Arctic Ocean. We use a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model to investigate possible effects of different atmospheric CO2 levels and gateway configurations between the North proto-Atlantic Basin and the Arctic Ocean on the formation of Arctic sea-ice in the latest Cretaceous. Sensitivity tests were run with two atmospheric CO2 levels (840 and 1120 ppm, representing 3× and 4× pre-industrial concentrations, respectively) with six paleogeographic configurations. In the experiment with 840 ppm CO2, seasonal Arctic sea-ice is observed in each gateway configuration in December–June, while for 1120 ppm sea-ice in the central Arctic is either limited or absent, depending on gateway configuration. This suggests the existence of a CO2 threshold, estimated between 3× and 4× pre-industrial (PI) CO2 levels. For higher atmospheric CO2 levels sea-ice formation can only occur by the combined effect of cold winds blowing over the Arctic from continental North America during boreal winter and seawater freshening. The latter can be caused by either very limited or an absence of gateway connections between the Arctic and the open ocean. Such a configuration likely developed in the latest Cretaceous, i.e. close to the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary interval.},

abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> River deltas are sites of sediment accumulation along the coastline that form critical biological habitats, host megacities, and contain significant quantities of hydrocarbons. Despite their importance, we do not know which factors most significantly promote sediment accumulation and dominate delta formation. To investigate this issue, we present a global dataset of 5,399 coastal rivers and data on eight environmental variables. Of these rivers, 40&thinsp;% (n = 2,174 deltas) have geomorphic deltas, defined either by a protrusion from the regional shoreline, a distributary channel network, or both. Globally, coastlines average one delta for every $\sim$&thinsp;300&thinsp;km of shoreline, but there are hotspots of delta formation. For example, in Southeast Asia there is one delta per 100&thinsp;km of shoreline. Our analysis shows that the likelihood of a river to form a delta increases with increasing water discharge, sediment discharge, and drainage basin area. On the other hand, delta likelihood decreases with increasing wave height and tidal range. Delta likelihood has a non-monotonic relationship with receiving basin slope: it decreases with steeper slopes but increases for slopes > 0.006. This relationship likely reflects different controls on delta formation on active versus passive margins. Sediment concentration and recent sea-level change do not affect delta likelihood. A logistic regression shows that water discharge, sediment discharge, wave height, and tidal range are most important for delta formation. The logistic regression correctly predicts delta formation 75&thinsp;% of the time. Our global analysis illustrates that delta formation and morphology represent a balance between constructive and destructive forces, and this framework may help predict tipping points where deltas rapidly shift morphologies.</p>},

Our results, obtained from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 302 Site M0004 in the Arctic Ocean, are based on molybdenum isotope determinations and molybdenum, rhenium, and uranium abundances. These data indicate a small global expansion of low-oxygen marine environments in the upper part of the PETM interval compared with the present day. More extensive seawater deoxygenation may have occurred for as long as $\sim$100 k.y., associated with a high rate of global warming and carbon oxidation at the start of the PETM. Our data also reveal molybdenum isotope compositions in Arctic Ocean deposits that are outside the range currently documented in marine environments. These exceptional compositions could reflect either the influence of hydrothermal inputs or equilibrium isotope fractionations associated with molybdenum sulfide speciation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The late Jurassic-early Cretaceous is commonly considered the only cold climatic interval in Earth history without any direct evidence of polar ice. A newly discovered dropstone-bearing interval from the subtropical Iberian Basin (western Tethys) is described and provides evidence of contemporaneous polar glaciation. This interval is correlated laterally for 4.8 km and contains a boulder and two cobble-sized quartzite dropstones that are encased in mid-Cretaceous fissile black shales and fine-grained sandstones. Based on previously published dimensions of similar large clasts, only glacial dropstones and impact ejecta blocks reach the dimensions of the boulder-sized dropstone reported from Iberia. The dropstones show morphological features compatible with glacial transport and abrasion in a subglacial setting which closely resembles the features observed in recent glacial boulders exposed near the snouts of glaciers in Iceland. These Late Aptian dropstones from Spain correlate with many other similar erratics in the northern and southern palaeohemispheres, and suggest that ice sheets formed around the palaeo-North Pole during certain periods of the early Cretaceous. Our results and associated evidence such as the occurrence of glendonites, tillites, moderate- to high-amplitude sea-level oscillations worldwide, minimum pCO2 concentrations, variation in calcareous nannofossil assemblages from low and high latitudes and isotopic excursions suggest that during the mid-Cretaceous there were periods of ice growth and decay that influenced the palaeotemperature, palaeoecology and sedimentology of the marine realm. The new data from Iberia are supported by recent results from Arctic Canada that indicate cool shelves and a mid-Cretaceous cold snap that developed for $\sim$6 Myr between 118 and 112 Ma. The late Aptian dropstones reported in eastern Iberia were likely transported from high northern latitudes towards subtropical ones in the western Tethys by an extreme iceberg drift similar to those occurring at the present day in the Atlantic Ocean. Icebergs released from a northern fringing ice sheet may have travelled southwards through the Greenland-Norwegian Seaway.},

abstract = {A deeper understanding of hyperthermal events in the Earth's history can provide an important scientific basis for understanding and coping with global warming in the Anthropocene. Two types of hyperthermal events are classified based on the characteristics of the carbon isotope excursion (CIE) of the five representative hyperthermal events in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The first type is overall characterized by negative CIEs (NCHE) and represented by the Permian-Triassic boundary event (PTB, $\sim$252 Ma), the early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (TOAE, $\sim$183 Ma), and the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum event (PETM, $\sim$56 Ma). The second type is overall characterized by positive CIEs (PCHE) and represented by the early Aptian oceanic anoxic event (OAE1a, $\sim$120 Ma) and the latest Cenomanian oceanic anoxic event (OAE2, $\sim$94 Ma). Hyperthermal events of negative CIEs (NCHE), lead to dramatic changes in temperature, sedimentation, and biodiversity. These events caused frequent occurrence of terrestrial wildfires, extreme droughts, acid rain, destruction of ozone layer, metal poisoning (such as mercury), changes in terrestrial water system, and carbonate platform demise, ocean acidification, ocean anoxia in marine settings, and various degree extinction of terrestrial and marine life, especially in shallow marine. In contrast, hyperthermal events of positive CIEs (PCHE), result in rapid warming of seawater and widespread oceanic anoxia, large-scale burial of organic matter and associated black shale deposition, which exerted more significant impacts on deep-water marine life, but little impacts on shallow sea and terrestrial life. While PCHEs were triggered by volcanism associated with LIPs in deep-sea environment, the released heat and nutrient were buffered by seawater due to their eruption in the deep sea, thus exerted more significant impacts on deep-marine biota than on shallow marine and terrestrial biota. This work enriches the study of hyperthermal events in geological history, not only for the understanding of hyperthermal events themselves, large igneous provinces, marine and terrestrial environment changes, mass extinctions, but also for providing a new method to identify the types of hyperthermal events and the inference of their driving mechanism based on the characteristics of carbon isotopic excursions and geological records.},

abstract = {The age of the ocean floor and its time-dependent age distribution control fundamental features of the Earth, such as bathymetry, sea level and mantle heat loss. Recently, the development of increasingly sophisticated reconstructions of past plate motions has provided models for plate kinematics and plate boundary evolution back in geological time. These models implicitly include the information necessary to determine the age of ocean floor that has since been lost to subduction. However, due to the lack of an automated and efficient method for generating global seafloor age grids, many tectonic models, most notably those extending back into the Paleozoic, are published without an accompanying set of age models for oceanic lithosphere. Here we present an automatic, tracer-based algorithm that generates seafloor age grids from global plate tectonic reconstructions with defined plate boundaries. Our method enables us to produce novel seafloor age models for the Paleozoic's lost ocean basins. Estimated changes in sea level based on bathymetry inferred from our new age grids show good agreement with sea level record estimations from proxies, providing a possible explanation for the peak in sea level during the assembly phase of Pangea. This demonstrates how our seafloor age models can be directly compared with observables from the geologic record that extend further back in time than the constraints from preserved seafloor. Thus, our new algorithm may also aid the further development of plate tectonic reconstructions by strengthening the links between geological observations and tectonic reconstructions of deeper time.},

The coincidence between the large $\Delta$33S and the first pulse of the Late Ordovician mass extinction about 445 million years ago suggests that stratospheric volcanic eruptions may have contributed to synergetic environmental deteriorations such as prolonged climatic perturbations and oceanic anoxia, related to the mass extinction.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Mass extinctions disrupt ecological communities. Although climate changes produce stress in ecological communities, few paleobiological studies have systematically addressed the impact of global climate changes on the fine details of community structure with a view to understanding how changes in community structure presage, or even cause, biodiversity decline during mass extinctions. Based on a novel Bayesian approach to biotope assessment, we present a study of changes in species abundance distribution patterns of macroplanktonic graptolite faunas (∼447-444 Ma) leading into the Late Ordovician mass extinction. Communities at two contrasting sites exhibit significant decreases in complexity and evenness as a consequence of the preferential decline in abundance of dysaerobic zone specialist species. The observed changes in community complexity and evenness commenced well before the dramatic population depletions that mark the tipping point of the extinction event. Initially, community changes tracked changes in the oceanic water masses, but these relations broke down during the onset of mass extinction. Environmental isotope and biomarker data suggest that sea surface temperature and nutrient cycling in the paleotropical oceans changed sharply during the latest Katian time, with consequent changes in the extent of the oxygen minimum zone and phytoplankton community composition. Although many impacted species persisted in ephemeral populations, increased extinction risk selectively depleted the diversity of paleotropical graptolite species during the latest Katian and early Hirnantian. The effects of long- Term climate change on habitats can thus degrade populations in ways that cascade through communities, with effects that culminate in mass extinction.},

We tested the hypothesis that expanded ocean anoxia drove widespread OC burial using uranium isotopes ($\delta$238U) of Lower Mississippian marine limestone as a global seawater redox proxy. The $\delta$238U trends record a large Tournaisian negative excursion lasting ∼1 m.y. The lack of covariation between $\delta$238U values and facies changes and proxies for local depositional and diagenetic influences suggests that the $\delta$238U trends represent a global seawater redox signal. The negative $\delta$238U excursion is coincident with the first TICE positive excursion, supporting the hypothesis that an expanded ocean anoxic event controlled OC burial. These results provide the first evidence from a global seawater redox proxy that an ocean anoxic event drove Tournaisian OC burial and controlled Early Mississippian cooling and glaciation. Uranium and carbon modeling results indicate that (1) there was an ∼6× increase in euxinic seafloor area, (2) OC burial was initially driven by expanded euxinia followed by expanded anoxic/suboxic conditions, and (3) OC burial mass was ∼4–17× larger than that sequestered during other major ocean anoxic events.},

abstract = {Concomitant to the decline of tropical corals caused by increasing global sea temperatures is the potential removal of barriers to species range expansions into subtropical and temperate habitats. In these habitats, species must tolerate lower annual mean temperature, wider annual temperature ranges and lower minimum temperatures. To understand ecophysiological traits that will impact geographical range boundaries, we monitored populations of five coral species within a marginal habitat and used a year of in situ measures to model thermal performance of vital host, symbiont and holobiont physiology. Metabolic responses to temperature revealed two acclimatization strategies: peak productivity occurring at annual midpoint temperatures (4 - 68C lower than tropical counterparts), or at annual maxima. Modelled relationships between temperature and P:R were compared to a year of daily subtropical sea temperatures and revealed that the relatively short time spent at any one temperature, limited optimal performance of all strategies to approximately half the days of the year. Thus, while subtropical corals can adjust their physiology to persist through seasonal lows, seasonal variation seems to be the key factor limiting coral productivity. This constraint on rapid reef accretion within subtropical environments provides insight into the global distribution of future coral reefs and their ecosystem services.},

Large-scale slope up toward the north or the west can significantly destabilize the circulation by modifying the barotropic flow and reducing the depth of convection. Wind stress stabilizes the circulation by deepening the thermocline in the subtropical gyre. Wind driving can also radically reduce the period of oscillations by destabilizing the northern halocline in the collapsed phase. The overall period of the oscillation is usually governed by the time taken for diffusive warming to destabilize the deep ocean.},

The southern cell fluctuates between two quasi-stationary states, with accompaning changes in the atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere. The transition between these states is rapid and resembles the polar halocline catastrophes and flushes as observed in ocean general circulation models under mixed boundary conditions. The sea-ice influence on both the surface heat and fresh water flux appears to be crucial for the existence and the prolongation of the quasi-stationary states.

abstract = {Rapid climate change is postulated to cause marine extinctions, especially among climate-sensitive clades, traits and regions1–6. This premise is based on two hypotheses: (1) known individual physiological sensitivities scale up to macroecological selectivity patterns4,7,8 and (2) ancient hyperthermal events are appropriate models to anticipate ecological winners and losers of anthropogenic climate change9. Yet these hypotheses have largely escaped quantitative appraisal. Here we show that experimental responses of modern marine ectotherms to single and combined climate-related stressors (such as seawater warming, hypoxia and acidification) align with Phanerozoic fossil extinction regimes across clades and functional traits. Of climate-related stressors, the synergistic interaction between warming and hypoxia10, encumbering aerobic metabolism, has the greatest potency as a proximate driver of extinction. All else being equal8, this synergy particularly imperils modern warm-water organisms. Modern–fossil agreement is strongest at intermediate–high extinction intensities and hyperthermal events but may fail at extreme extinction events, perhaps due to rising prominences of, and interactions among, additional biotic and abiotic stressors. According to results from marine ectotherms, clade-based sensitivity of individuals to climate-related stressors scales up from subannual experiments and decadal range-shift response magnitudes11, to extinction selectivity patterns at ancient climate-related stressor events and the Phanerozoic durations of genera.},

abstract = {The early Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) 1a represents a major perturbation of the Earth's climate system and in particular the carbon cycle, as evidenced by widespread preservation of organic matter in marine settings and a characteristic negative carbon isotopic excursion (CIE) at its onset, followed by a broad positive CIE. The contemporaneous emplacement of a large igneous province (LIP) is invoked as a trigger for OAE 1a (and OAEs in general), but this link and the ultimate source of the carbon perturbation at the onset of OAEs is still debated. In this study, we simultaneously assimilate an atmospheric pCO2 reconstruction along with a $\delta$13C record from the Spanish Cau section in an Earth system model to obtain a novel transient reconstruction of emission rates and identify the primary carbon-emitting sources across the negative CIE interval at the onset of OAE 1a. We reconstruct carbon emissions of 4,300–29,200 Pg from a mixture of carbon sources. This estimate is a lower bound, as contemporaneous organic carbon burial is not accounted for. Carbon was first released at slow rates from a 13C-depleted reservoir (e.g. thermo- and/or biogenic methane from sill intrusions). Towards the end of the negative CIE the rate of emissions increased and they became more 13C-enriched, likely from a dominantly volcanic source (e.g. LIPs). New osmium isotope (187Os/188Os) measurements, from the same section as the pCO2 reconstruction and $\delta$13C data, reveal a shift to less radiogenic values coinciding with the change towards mantle-derived carbon emissions as indicated by our modelling results, lending further support to our interpretation. These results highlight that geologically triggered carbon emissions were likely driving the OAE onset.},

abstract = {The taxonomic and ecologic composition of Earth's biota has shifted dramatically through geologic time, with some clades going extinct while others diversified. Here, we derive a metric that quantifies the change in biotic composition due to extinction or origination and show that it equals the product of extinction/origination magnitude and selectivity (variation in magnitude among groups). We also define metrics that describe the extent to which a recovery (1) reinforced or reversed the effects of extinction on biotic composition and (2) changed composition in ways uncorrelated with the extinction. To demonstrate the approach, we analyzed an updated compilation of stratigraphic ranges of marine animal genera. We show that mass extinctions were not more selective than background intervals at the phylum level; rather, they tended to drive greater taxonomic change due to their higher magnitudes. Mass extinctions did not represent a separate class of events with respect to either strength of selectivity or effect. Similar observations apply to origination during recoveries from mass extinctions, and on average, extinction and origination were similarly selective and drove similar amounts of biotic change. Elevated origination during recoveries drove bursts of compositional change that varied considerably in effect. In some cases, origination partially reversed the effects of extinction, returning the biota toward the pre-extinction composition; in others, it reinforced the effects of the extinction, magnifying biotic change. Recoveries were as important as extinction events in shaping the marine biota, and their selectivity deserves systematic study alongside that of extinction.},

abstract = {Throughout the history of complex life, Earth's climate and biogeochemical cycles have been perturbed by Large Igneous Province (LIP) volcanism, with several LIP episodes correlating with major mass extinction events. Yet many aspects of the interplay between geological, climatic and ecological processes in the Earth System during these times of global upheaval remain poorly understood. This study focuses on the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province and the associated extinction event in the latest Triassic, about 201 million years ago. Although climate and carbon cycle models successfully reproduce aspects of the end-Triassic environmental changes, many questions regarding the causal and temporal relations behind them remain unresolved. Here, we report an effort to model and quantify the dynamic response of the Earth System to short pulses of volcanogenic volatile emissions for an ensemble of emission scenarios. For the first time in the context of the end-Triassic events, this is done with a coupled climate model and under consideration of both carbon and sulfur emissions. Tested are pulses with ∼1−6 kyr duration during which 2500−7500GtC are emitted and 0−500GtS form stratospheric sulfate aerosols. The simultaneous emission of carbon and sulfur during one pulse of volcanic activity causes climatic fluctuations on annual to millennial timescales: A sequence of transient global cooling and subsequent sustained warming, overprinted with high interannual variability. The simulated maximum global warming ranges from +1.8 to +4.4 °C, while the amplitude of cooling is considerably higher in the upper range of the tested sulfur emission scenarios. The magnitude of temperature change varies regionally, being lowest in the Tethys realm. Changes in steric sea level (∼1−3 m) and ocean overturning strength, a surface ocean pH decrease (∼0.2−0.4) and a drop of the carbonate saturation especially in the Tethys are also obtained from the simulations during each emission pulse. By evaluating the simulated temperature changes against thermal tolerance limits of stony corals in a simplified manner, we find that these are not clearly transgressed on a global scale in the simulated warming scenarios. However, the climatic variability potentially introduced by the volcanic forcing would have represented significant stress for marine organisms. This study represents a significant step towards integrating multiple volcanic forcing mechanisms and environmental response processes in space and time to yield a more complete picture of impacts of CAMP volcanism and LIPs in general.},

abstract = {The subduction of upper oceanic lithosphere acts as a primary driver of Earth's deep carbon and water cycles, providing a key transportation mechanism between surface systems and the deep Earth. Carbon and water are stored and transported in altered oceanic lithosphere. In this study, we present mass estimates of the subducted carbon and serpentinite flux from 320 to 0 Ma. Flux estimates are calculated using a full-plate tectonic reconstruction to build a descriptive model of oceanic lithosphere at points along mid-ocean ridges. These points then track the kinematic evolution of the lithosphere until subduction. To address uncertainties of modeled spreading rates in synthetic ocean basins, we consider the preserved recent (83–0 Ma) spreading history of the Pacific Ocean to be representative of the Panthalassa Ocean. This analysis suggests present-day subducting upper oceanic lithosphere contains 10–39 Mt/a of carbon and 900–3500 Mt/a of serpentinite (∼150–450 Mt/a of water). The highest rates of carbon delivery to trenches (20–100 Mt/a) occurred during the Early Cretaceous, as upper oceanic lithosphere subducted during this period formed in times of warm bottom water and the Cretaceous period experienced high seafloor production and consumption rates. Additionally, there are several episodes of high serpentinite delivery to trenches over the last 100 Ma, driven by extensive serpentinization of mantle peridotites exposed at slow spreading ridges. We propose variations in subduction regimes act as the principal control on the subduction of carbon stored in upper oceanic lithosphere, as since 320 Ma the volume of stored carbon across all ocean basins varies by less than an order of magnitude. For pre-Pangea times (<300 Ma), this suggests estimates of seafloor consumption represent a reasonable first-order approximation of carbon delivery. Serpentinite and associated water flux at subduction zones appear to be primarily controlled by the spreading regime at mid-ocean ridges. This is apparent during times of supercontinent breakup where slow spreading ridges produce highly serpentinized crust, and is observed in the present-day Atlantic, Arctic and Indian oceans, where our model suggests upper oceanic lithosphere is up to ∼100 times more enriched in serpentinite than the Panthalassa and Pacific oceans.},

abstract = {The Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2, ca. 94.6 Ma) is one of the major perturbations in the global carbon cycle during the Phanerozoic. Stable carbon isotopes ($\delta$13C) from marine and continental sedimentary environments document this carbon cycle perturbation with a pronounced (> 2‰) positive carbon isotope excursion (CIE). Although the OAE2 stratigraphic interval has been intensively studied in terms of paleoceanography and paleoclimatology, several climatic and carbon cycle aspects are not yet well-understood. In particular, cyclic short-term Milankovitch-scale $\delta$13C variations within the OAE2 and their potential implications for the global carbon cycle have been rarely addressed. Here, we present high-resolution (5 cm, $\sim$2 kyr) $\delta$13C data spanning the OAE2 from the Paris Basin Chalk (Poigny Craie-701 drill-core) to show high amplitude short-term $\delta$13C oscillations, superimposed on the major CIE. Time-series analysis indicates that short-term oscillations are astronomically paced, with eccentricity cycles being the most prominent. Orbital forcing of $\delta$13C variations is further supported by time-series analysis of the English Chalk (Eastbourne section). We suggest that orbitally paced carbon cycle oscillations were amplified by considerable emission of greenhouse gases from volcanism that caused the overall CIE. Astronomical calibration of the whole OAE2 (the perturbation and recovery phases) from the Poigny record provides a duration equivalent to eight to eight and a half short eccentricity cycles. Cyclostratigraphic correlations among several OAE2 key records indicate the same duration of the whole CIE. However, duration of the interval from the onset of CIE till the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary (CTB) is significantly different from one basin to another. In particular, a difference of almost two short eccentricity cycles is highlighted between the Anglo-Paris and Western Interior basins. According to cyclostratigraphic approach and correlations, the entry of W. devonense was at least 200 kyr later in the Western Interior Basin (WIB, USA) than in Europe. Key calcareous nannofossil biohorizons (e.g., Quadrum gartneri) are also stratigraphically upshifted in the WIB with respect to the European sections, hence concurring with the hypothesis of a younger CTB in the WIB. We ascribe such significant temporal offset to diachroneity of the CTB, which is likely the result of different, regional biotic responses to the global OAE2 paleoenvironmental perturbation.},

abstract = {Conflicting published interpretations of marine redox conditions during the Ordovician-Silurian transition (OST) may have been linked to spatial redox heterogeneity during this interval. However, details of the pattern of redox heterogeneity and its underlying causes remain unclear. Here, we present a high-resolution geochemical study of a drillcore section (Pengye #1) from Pengshui County (Chongqing municipality, southwestern China) that was located in the semi-restricted inner Yangtze Sea during the OST. We analyzed Fe-speciation, redox-sensitive trace elements, major elements, and pyrite $\delta$34S compositions ($\delta$34Spy) and then compared these data with published results from coeval sections at Datianba and Shuanghe in the same basin. The integrated dataset demonstrates pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity of redox conditions—especially the local development of euxinic conditions in the inner Yangtze Sea during the OST. Integrated data further suggest that high primary productivity and ample Fe fluxes in the inner Yangtze Sea may have depleted dissolved sulfate through microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) and subsequent pyrite formation, except in areas with enhanced sulfate supply from continental weathering or open-ocean exchange, which varied as a function of both tectonic (i.e., the regional Kwangsian Orogeny) and eustatic changes (i.e., the global Hirnantian glaciation). Limited sulfate availability thus likely prevented the development of euxinic conditions in some regions of the inner Yangtze Sea, as reflected in spatial variation of $\delta$34Spy. Our study highlights the potential role of sulfate availability on the development of watermass euxinia in semi-restricted marginal-marine basins during the OST.},

abstract = {Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were major perturbations of the Earth system, associated with high CO 2 concentrations in the oceans and atmosphere, high temperatures, and widespread organic-carbon burial. Models for explaining OAEs and other similar phenomena in Earth history make specific predictions about the role and pattern of temperature change, which can be tested through comparison with the geological record. Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2) occurred $\sim$94 m.y. ago and is commonly considered as the type example of an OAE. However, temperature change during this event is constrained largely from Northern Hemisphere sites. In order to understand whether such records represent global patterns, we use an organic geochemical paleothermometer (TEX 86 ) to provide the first detailed Cenomanian- Turonian record of paleotemperatures from the Southern Hemisphere (Ocean Drilling Program Site 1138; paleolatitude of $\sim$47°S). Consideration of this record, Northern Hemisphere records, and general circulation model simulations suggests that global temperatures peaked during OAE 2 but remained high into the early Turonian due to elevated CO 2 . These results suggest that the burial of organic carbon during the whole of OAE 2 did not, of itself, lead to global cooling and that CO 2 remained high into the early Turonian. This climatic evolution suggests that cooling was not the driving mechanism for the termination of OAE 2 and that cessation of widespread anoxic conditions required changes in other factors, such as sea levels, the availability of easily weathered silicate rocks, and/or nutrient sequestration in black shales.},

abstract = {To date, many general circulation model (GCM) experiments have failed to reproduce the warm, high latitude temperatures suggested for the Cretaceous by geological proxy climate indicators, especially for the Northern Hemisphere and within continental interiors. The vast majority of these proxies are biologically based, and it is important to determine whether alternative sedimentologically based proxies indicate similar cold biases in models. Therefore, we have performed an evaluation of the very latest generation of climate model predictions for terrestrial sites using climatically sensitive sediments as palaeoclimate indicators. Evidence from the geological record, comprising coal/peat, evaporites, bauxite and laterite deposits, are portrayed on a series of palaeoclimate-data maps. These are then compared with the global distributions of potential deposits generated from model simulations of the Maastrichtian using versions of the Hadley Centre climate model. The Maastrichtian was chosen because of the greater range and sophistication of GCMs adapted for its climate simulation and sediment prediction than for other Cretaceous stages. This thus represents the first attempt at comparing such state-of-the-art models to lithological climate indicators and quantifying their relative performances.For peat/coal, there is generally good correspondence between Maastrichtian model predictions for predicted potential deposits and the observed record. For evaporites, there is also very close agreement between predictions by the models and the geological record, minor differences between the individual model versions resulting from their differing levels of atmospheric CO 2 and the different palaeogeographical representations of intracontinental seaways in the Northern Hemisphere. For bauxites and laterites, the models predict less than half of the documented deposits, successfully portraying equatorial accumulations but omitting the majority of mid to high latitude deposits. The main discrepancy is therefore identified as the failure of all models to predict bauxite and laterite deposits corresponding with recorded accumulations within the mid to high latitudes of Europe and Asia. In many cases, the effects of CO 2 have minimal impact on the skill of model prediction. However, for evaporite distributions, the low CO 2 model is appreciably worse. In general, the best match across the geological data and models is achieved by the simulation with open Northern Hemisphere seaways.Overall, these results confirm those inferred from biological proxies, showing that climate models have a serious cold bias in high latitudes and continental interiors during the Cretaceous and that the latest generation of climate models still produces results which are incompatible with the geological data. Levels of atmospheric CO 2 and uncertainties in palaeogeography cannot explain the discrepancy. The cold bias is common to many climate models, and suggests that a process or mechanism is poorly represented or omitted in the current generation of climate models, or that we are failing to recognise a major boundary condition change in the Cretaceous. If the former, this implies that we may be underestimating the extent of extreme future climate change at high latitudes and in continental interiors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Jenkyns2017,
abstract = {Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (Cenomanian–Turonian: ca 94 Ma) represents a major palaeoceanographic phenomenon that took place during an interval of extreme global warmth when large amounts of organic matter entered the marine burial record, probably triggered by increased availability of nutrients for planktonic biota. Three sections (Eastbourne, Sussex, UK; Raia del Pedale, Campania, Italy; and Tarfaya, Morocco) recording this event illustrate the influence on marine geochemistry of mafic volcanic rock-seawater interaction, anoxia to euxinia, and re-oxygenation and cooling during the so-called ‘Plenus Cold Event'. The Eastbourne section represents the organic-lean epicontinental pelagic deposits of the English Chalk; the Raia del Pedale section represents a shallow-water platform carbonate on the Tethyan continental margin, also largely devoid of organic matter; and the Tarfaya core represents an Atlantic margin site where cyclically bedded organic-rich sediments were well developed. Correlation between all three sections is readily achieved by biostratigraphy and carbon-isotope stratigraphy ($\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg) over the Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 interval, represented by a characteristic broad positive carbon-isotope excursion. The stratigraphic range of the Plenus Cold Event, defined by the presence, in two discrete levels, of boreal fauna and an excursion to heavier oxygen-isotope values in the English Chalk, can be identified in Raia del Pedale and Tarfaya by using the carbon-isotope curve as a correlative tool. Similarly, a section in southern France allows its co-existing osmium-isotope excursion to relatively unradiogenic values to be placed in the context of the Oceanic Anoxic Event in all three analysed sections. A fall to lower osmium-isotope values clearly pre-dated the onset of Oceanic Anoxic Event 2, as defined by the initial rise in carbon-isotope values, allowing the putative magmatic/mafic event as a trigger for the Oceanic Anoxic Event. An initial drop in sulphur-isotope ratios ($\delta$34SCAS) at Eastbourne correlates with the osmium-isotope curve, suggesting that isotopically light sulphur could have been derived from a mafic igneous source. Re-oxygenation of sediments of all three investigated sections during the Plenus Cold Event is variably illustrated by change in cerium:calcium, iodine:calcium, molybedenum:calcium and uranium:calcium ratios, according to the redox behaviour of the elements in question and whether controls on seawater chemistry were local or global in nature. Changes in molybdenum-isotope ratios from Tarfaya and portions of the sulphur-isotope curve from Eastbourne and Raia del Pedale also indicate the probable presence of more oxygen-rich bottom waters during the Plenus Cold Event. Oxidation by such waters of previously deposited organic-rich shales, as well as loss of anoxic/euxinic sinks, is credited with temporarily enriching global seawater in a range of other redox-sensitive trace metals (for example, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd) during ongoing basalt-seawater interaction indicated by persistent relatively non-radiogenic osmium-isotope seawater values. However, early diagenetic enrichment of manganese in the English Chalk over much of the Oceanic Anoxic Event interval is broadly correlative in time with relatively low osmium-isotope values in sections elsewhere: a relationship that may be due to the lack of affinity of manganese with carbon-rich shales, hence allowing relatively elevated concentrations of the element in marine waters to persist during leaching of mafic rocks, unlike other redox-sensitive species. The calcium-isotope and lithium-isotope ratios from Eastbourne and Raia del Pedale indicate an increase in global weathering during the initial phase of Oceanic Anoxic Event 2, and the shift in strontium isotopes and osmium isotopes to more unradiogenic values during the event suggests that not only construction but also destruction of one or more Large Igneous Provinces was probably a proximal cause of this major palaeoceanographic phenomenon by elevating nutrient levels and planktonic productivity in large tracts of the world ocean. Globally widespread carbon burial and silicate weathering are both identified as important mechanisms for drawing down atmospheric carbon dioxide that, in the absence of overwhelming volcanogenic replenishment of this greenhouse gas during the early phase of Oceanic Anoxic Event 2, caused the Plenus Cold Event.},

abstract = {Global warming lowers the solubility of gases in the ocean and drives an enhanced hydrological cycle with increased nutrient loads delivered to the oceans, leading to increases in organic production, the degradation of which causes a further decrease in dissolved oxygen. In extreme cases in the geological past, this trajectory has led to catastrophic marine oxygen depletion during the so-called oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). How the water column oscillated between generally oxic conditions and local/global anoxia remains a challenging question, exacerbated by a lack of sensitive redox proxies, especially for the suboxic window. To address this problem, we use bulk carbonate I/Ca to reconstruct subtle redox changes in the upper ocean water column at seven sites recording the Cretaceous OAE 2. In general, I/Ca ratios were relatively low preceding and during the OAE interval, indicating deep suboxic or anoxic waters exchanging directly with near-surface waters. However, individual sites display a wide range of initial values and excursions in I/Ca through the OAE interval, reflecting the importance of local controls and suggesting a high spatial variability in redox state. Both I/Ca and an Earth System Model suggest that the northeast proto-Atlantic had notably higher oxygen levels in the upper water column than the rest of the North Atlantic, indicating that anoxia was not global during OAE 2 and that important regional differences in redox conditions existed. A lack of correlation with calcium, lithium, and carbon isotope records suggests that neither enhanced global weathering nor carbon burial was a dominant control on the I/Ca proxy during OAE 2.},

abstract = {We have developed a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model, the GENESIS-MOM model, with the ability to transport and fractionate water isotopes in the ocean and atmosphere. The model is used to predict modern and Cretaceous precipitation and seawater $\delta$18O. The model reproduces the large-scale modernday isotopic distribution. In the zonal mean, the difference between simulated and observed seawater $\delta$18O is within 0.2‰ in the low and middle latitudes and within 1‰ at high latitudes. In comparison to modern, simulated Cretaceous surface seawater $\delta$18O is systematically depleted by 0.3‰ at low and middle latitudes. These differences are attributed to equilibrium fractionation during surface evaporation at low latitudes and an increased partitioning of 18O from the surface into the deep ocean due to intermediate and deep water formation in subtropical basins in the Cretaceous. We also find that regional seawater $\delta$18O is significantly influenced by the paleobathymetry and the resolution of oceanic gateways, boundary conditions that are not well known for the past. Our simulation of Cretaceous seawater $\delta$18O has major implications for oxygen isotope paleothermometry. We conclude that conventional assumptions of past seawater $\delta$18O may lead to an overestimate of Cretaceous sea-surface temperatures, especially at middle and high latitudes.

In Australia, the species is targeted by recreational anglers only, under the assumption that most of the sharks are released and populations remain minimally impacted. If released sharks do not survive, the current management strategy will need to be revised. Shortfin mako sharks are commonly subjected to lengthy angling events; however, their endothermic physiology may provide an advantage over ectothermic fishes when recovering from exercise. This study assessed the post-release survival of recreationally caught shortfin mako sharks using Survivorship Pop-up Archival Transmitting (sPAT) tags and examined physiological indicators of capture stress from blood samples as well as any injuries that may be caused by hook selection. Survival estimates were based on 30 shortfin mako sharks captured off the southeastern coast of Australia. Three mortalities were observed over the duration of the study, yielding an overall survival rate of 90%. All mortalities occurred in sharks angled for < 30 min. Sharks experienced increasing plasma lactate with longer fight times and higher sea surface temperatures (SSTs), increased plasma glucose at higher SSTs and depressed expression of heat shock protein 70 and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate at higher SSTs. Long fight times did not impact survival. Circle hooks significantly reduced foul hooking when compared with J hooks. Under the conditions of this study, we found that physical injury associated with hook choice is likely to have contributed to an increased likelihood of mortality, whereas the high aerobic scope associated with the species' endothermy probably enabled it to cope with long fight times and the associated physiological responses to capture.},

abstract = {The Ellis Bay Formation on Anticosti Island has long been recognized for the biostratigraphic importance of its latest Ordovician conodont, palynomorph, and shelly fossil assemblages. However, a sparse record of graptolites has made it difficult to correlate these assemblages with the graptolite biozonation. Restudy of some previously described and examination of newly collected normalograptid specimens from the Ellis Bay and lower Becscie formations, however, shows that biostratigraphically important taxa are present and these species provide important constraints on the age of the strata. Normalograptus parvulus and N. minor have been identified in the upper half of the Ellis Bay Formation, suggesting that these strata are late Hirnantian in age (N. persculptus Biozone). Normalograptus imperfectus and Normalograptus sp. aff. N. acceptus occur in the basal beds of the Becscie Formation, indicating that these strata are earliest Silurian. These graptolite data support the hypothesis that the positive carbon isotope excursion seen in the uppermost strata of the Ellis Bay Formation is isochronous with that seen in the Hirnantian strata at Dob's Linn, Scotland, and does not span much of the lower to mid-Hirnantian, as is the case in Arctic Canada and Nevada, USA. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors, Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 The Lethaia Foundation.},

abstract = {Following partial closure of the northern Iapetus Ocean along the Newfoundland segment of the St. Lawrence Promontory, subsidence along the Anticosti Platform was influenced by residual thermal subsidence, renewed tectonic loading by thrust sheets to the south, and sediment loading. Basement subsidence, calculated by removing the effects of sediment loading, was between 2 and 5 cm/ka in the Caradocian, increasing to 8.6 cm/ka in the Pusgillian and Cautleyan, and reaching a maximum of 17.7 cm/ka in the Rawtheyan, during deposition of the Princeton Lake and Vaur{\'{e}}al Formations. A marked decline in subsidence, beginning in the Hirnantian and continuing into the Early Silurian, may reflect decoupling of thrust loads to the south, although a further stage of thrust loading may have occurred in the Aeronian during deposition of the lower part of the Jupiter Formation. Storm frequency curves, produced using tempestite abundance, thickness, and grain size through more than a kilometre of carbonate strata on Anticosti Island, allow recognition of long period, 3rd-order trends. These are in part similar to local sea-level trends deduced from direct interpretation of sedimentary structures, but depart significantly from paleontological-based sea-level curves. Shorter period 4th-order cycles appear to be related to orbital eccentricity with periods of 100 and 400 ka. These may reflect periods with falling sea levels, increasing storm activity, or enhanced sediment flux to the middle and outer shelf. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC Canada.},

abstract = {Carbon is a key control on the surface chemistry and climate of Earth. Significant volumes of carbon are input to the oceans and atmosphere from deep Earth in the form of degassed CO2 and are returned to large carbon reservoirs in the mantle via subduction or burial. Different tectonic settings (e.g., volcanic arcs, mid-ocean ridges, and continental rifts) emit fluxes of CO2 that are temporally and spatially variable, and together they represent a first-order control on carbon outgassing from the deep Earth. A change in the relative importance of different tectonic settings throughout Earth's history has therefore played a key role in balancing the deep carbon cycle on geological timescales. Over the past 10 years the Deep Carbon Observatory has made enormous progress in constraining estimates of carbon outgassing flux at different tectonic settings. Using plate boundary evolution modeling and our understanding of present-day carbon fluxes, we develop time series of carbon fluxes into and out of the Earth's interior through the past 200 million years. We highlight the increasing importance of carbonate-intersecting subduction zones over time to carbon outgassing, and the possible dominance of carbon outgassing at continental rift zones, which leads to maxima in outgassing at 130 and 15 Ma. To a first-order, carbon outgassing since 200 Ma may be net positive, averaging ∼50 Mt C yr–1 more than the ingassing flux at subduction zones. Our net outgassing curve is poorly correlated with atmospheric CO2, implying that surface carbon cycling processes play a significant role in modulating carbon concentrations and/or there is a long-term crustal or lithospheric storage of carbon which modulates the outgassing flux. Our results highlight the large uncertainties that exist in reconstructing the corresponding in- and outgassing fluxes of carbon. Our synthesis summarizes our current understanding of fluxes at tectonic settings and their influence on atmospheric CO2, and provides a framework for future research into Earth's deep carbon cycling, both today and in the past.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic warming is expected to drive oxygen out of the ocean as the water temperature rises and the rate of exchange between subsurface waters and the atmosphere slows due to enhanced upper ocean density stratification. Observations from recent decades are tantalizingly consistent with this prediction, though these changes remain subtle in the face of natural variability. Earth system model projections unanimously predict a long-term decrease in the global ocean oxygen inventory, but show regional discrepancies, particularly in the most oxygen-depleted waters, owing to the complex interplay between oxygen supply pathways and oxygen consumption. The geological record provides an orthogonal perspective, showing how the oceanic oxygen content varied in response to prior episodes of climate change. These past changes were much slower than the current, anthropogenic change, but can help to appraise sensitivities, and point toward potentially dominant mechanisms of change. Consistent with the model projections, marine sediments recorded an overall expansion of low-oxygen waters in the upper ocean as it warmed at the end of the last ice age. This expansion was not linearly related with temperature, though, but reached a deoxygenation extreme midway through the warming. Meanwhile, the deep ocean became better oxygenated, opposite the general expectation. These observations require that significant changes in apparent oxygen utilization occurred, suggesting that they will also be important in the future. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The Oceanography Society.

abstract = {Enhanced ocean carbon storage during the Pleistocene ice ages lowered atmospheric CO2 concentrations by 80 to 100 ppm relative to interglacial levels. Leading hypotheses to explain this phenomenon invoke a greater efficiency of the ocean's biological pump, in which case carbon storage in the deep sea would have been accompanied by a corresponding reduction in dissolved oxygen. We exploit the sensitivity of organic matter preservation in marine sediments to bottom water oxygen concentration to constrain the level of dissolved oxygen in the deep central equatorial Pacific Ocean during the last glacial period (18,000–28,000 years BP) to have been within the range of 20–50 $\mu$mol/kg, much less than the modern value of $\sim$168 $\mu$mol/kg. We further demonstrate that reduced oxygen levels characterized the water column below a depth of $\sim$1,000 m. Converting the ice age oxygen level to an equivalent concentration of respiratory CO2, and extrapolating globally, we estimate that deep-sea CO2 storage during the last ice age exceeded modern values by as much as 850 Pg C, sufficient to balance the loss of carbon from the atmosphere ($\sim$200 Pg C) and from the terrestrial biosphere ($\sim$300–600 Pg C). In addition, recognizing the enhanced preservation of organic matter in ice age sediments of the deep Pacific Ocean helps reconcile previously unexplained inconsistencies among different geochemical and micropaleontological proxy records used to assess past changes in biological productivity of the ocean.},

abstract = {During the last glacial termination, the solubility of gases in the ocean decreased as ocean temperatures rose. However, marine sediments have not unanimously recorded ocean deoxygenation throughout this time. Some records show increasing oxygenation since the Last Glacial Maximum, particularly in the deep sea, while many document abrupt oxygenation changes, often associated with apparent changes in the formation rate of North Atlantic Deep Water. Here we present a global compilation of marine sediment proxy records that reveals remarkable coherency between regional oxygenation changes throughout deglaciation. The upper ocean generally became less oxygenated, but this general trend included pauses and even reversals, reflecting changes in nutrient supply, respiration rates and ventilation. The most pronounced deoxygenation episode in the upper ocean occurred midway through the deglaciation, associated with a reinvigoration of North Atlantic Deep Water formation. At this time, the upper Indo-Pacific Ocean was less oxygenated than today. Meanwhile, the bulk of the deep ocean became more oxygenated over the deglaciation, reflecting a transfer of respired carbon to the atmosphere. The observed divergence from a simple solubility control emphasizes the degree to which oxygen consumption patterns can be altered by changes in ocean circulation and marine ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Mid-Cretaceous (Barremian-Turonian) plankton preserved in deep-sea marl, organic-rich shale, and pelagic carbonate hold an important record of how the marine biosphere responded to short- and long-term changes in the ocean-climate system. Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were short-lived episodes of organic carbon burial that are distinguished by their widespread distribution as discrete beds of black shale and/or pronounced carbon isotopic excursions. OAE1a in the early Aptian (∼120.5 Ma) and OAE2 at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary (∼93.5 Ma) were global in their distribution and associated with heightened marine productivity. OAE1b spans the Aptian/Albian boundary (∼113-109 Ma) and represents a protracted interval of dysoxia with multiple discrete black shales across parts of Tethys (including Mexico), while OAE1d developed across eastern and western Tethys and in other locales during the latest Albian (∼99.5 Ma). Mineralized plankton experienced accelerated rates of speciation and extinction at or near the major Cretaceous OAEs, and strontium isotopic evidence suggests a possible link to times of rapid oceanic plateau formation and/or increased rates of ridge crest volcanism. Elevated levels of trace metals in OAE1a and OAE2 strata suggest that marine productivity may have been facilitated by increased availability of dissolved iron. The association of plankton turnover and carbon isotopic excursions with each of the major OAEs, despite the variable geographic distribution of black shale accumulation, points to widespread changes in the ocean-climate system. Ocean crust production and hydrothermal activity increased in the late Aptian. Faster spreading rates [and/or increased ridge length] drove a long-term (Albian-early Turonian) rise in sea level and CO2-induced global warming. Changes in ocean circulation, water column stratification, and nutrient partitioning lead to a reorganization of plankton community structure and widespread carbonate (chalk) deposition during the Late Cretaceous. We conclude that there were important linkages between submarine volcanism, plankton evolution, and the cycling of carbon through the marine biosphere.},

abstract = {Over geological timescales, CO2 levels are determined by the operation of the long term carbon cycle, and it is generally thought that changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration have controlled variations in Earth's surface temperature over the Phanerozoic Eon. Here we compile independent estimates for global average surface temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration, and compare these to the predictions of box models of the long term carbon cycle COPSE and GEOCARBSULF. We find a strong relationship between CO2 forcing and temperature from the proxy data, for times where data is available, and we find that current published models reproduce many aspects of CO2 change, but compare poorly to temperature estimates. Models are then modified in line with recent advances in understanding the tectonic controls on carbon cycle source and sink processes, with these changes constrained by modelling 87Sr/86Sr ratios. We estimate CO2 degassing rates from the lengths of subduction zones and rifts, add differential effects of erosion rates on the weathering of silicates and carbonates, and revise the relationship between global average temperature changes and the temperature change in key weathering zones. Under these modifications, models produce combined records of CO2 and temperature change that are reasonably in line with geological and geochemical proxies (e.g. central model predictions are within the proxy windows for >$\sim$75% of the time covered by data). However, whilst broad long-term changes are reconstructed, the models still do not adequately predict the timing of glacial periods. We show that the 87Sr/86Sr record is largely influenced by the weathering contributions of different lithologies, and is strongly controlled by erosion rates, rather than being a good indicator of overall silicate chemical weathering rates. We also confirm that a combination of increasing erosion rates and decreasing degassing rates over the Neogene can cause the observed cooling and Sr isotope changes without requiring an overall increase in silicate weathering rates. On the question of a source or sink dominated carbon cycle, we find that neither alone can adequately reconstruct the combination of CO2, temperature and strontium isotope dynamics over Phanerozoic time, necessitating a combination of changes to sources and sinks. Further progress in this field relies on >108 year dynamic spatial reconstructions of ancient tectonics, paleogeography and hydrology. Whilst this is a significant challenge, the latest reconstruction techniques, proxy records and modelling advances make this an achievable target.},

abstract = {Brachiopods, trilobites, cements and whole rock (=matrix) material were evaluated for their reliability as proxies of original seawater carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope chemistry. In this process, coeval material was evaluated from individual horizons of formations spanning the Permian to Cambrian. Unaltered shells of low-Mg calcite articulated brachiopods, retain original seawater oxygen, carbon and strontium isotope compositions, as old as late Ordovician. Assessments of older specimens are hampered by a lack of suitable material (coeval brachiopod-whole rock sets). A definitive assessment of cement marine chemistry is difficult due to the paucity of material, but despite this caveat, cements hold some promise for retaining original carbon and possibly strontium isotope seawater values. In contrast, the potential of whole rock material as a proxy of original seawater chemistry is quite complex. In some, but not all instances, the carbon isotopic composition of whole rock, after detailed scrutiny and evaluation, appears to represent an original seawater chemistry signal. In a few instances, their oxygen isotope compositions reflect original seawater values. Unlike the stable isotope compositions, the strontium isotopes of all studied whole rock material (Permian to upper Cambrian) appear not to reflect original seawater chemistry values. Thus the potential for retaining original seawater isotope chemistry and serving as specific proxies, in order of decreasing reliability, are (1) unaltered low-Mg calcite brachiopods (C, O and Sr isotopes), (2) pristine marine cements (C and Sr isotopes), and (3) whole rock material (C isotopes?). Carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope compositions of Ordovician trilobites mirror those of coeval unaltered brachiopods. Cambrian trilobites hold significant promise as an important proxy of original seawater isotope chemistry but further studies are needed to ascertain their full potential. The survey of isotopes in some Ordovician and Cambrian intermediate/low-Mg calcite trilobites demonstrates their potential as an important proxy of original seawater chemistry. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Late Ordovician culminated in a major glacial period that has been related to one of the strongest mass extinctions recorded during the Phanerozoic. During this interval, Anticosti Island (Qu{\'{e}}bec, eastern Canada) was located at low to intermediate palaeolatitudes (15-30° S) on the eastern margin of Laurentia. It displays a relatively complete section across the Ordovician-Silurian (O/S) boundary. Upper Ordovician to Lower Silurian strata of Anticosti studied here comprise the Vaur{\'{e}}al (Katian), Ellis Bay (Hirnantian) and Becscie (latest Hirnantian-Rhuddanian) formations. Phytoplankton dynamics inferred from the acritarch content of these strata are locally compared with new geochemical environmental proxies ($\delta$13C), with recent palynological data from Baltica and also with phytoplankton dynamics as described from near-polar, high latitude localities of the Gondwana region. Two positive excursions of the carbon isotope record have been identified in the lower and upper Ellis Bay Formation.Overall, phytoplankton trends are as follows: (1) as with chitinozoans, conodonts, brachiopods and corals, acritarchs from Anticosti display a major turn-over during the early Hirnantian (uppermost Vaur{\'{e}}al Formation-lower Ellis Bay Formation), with the appearance of taxa that exhibit Silurian affinities (e.g., Tylotopalla sp., Ammonidium sp., Oppilatala sp., Evittia sp., Dilatisphaera spp.). High polymorphism for some common taxa is observed in the interval corresponding to the first $\delta$13C positive excursion. Using sequence stratigraphy, this period may be related to a first glacially driven sea-level drawdown corresponding to terrestrial ice-sheet growth on Gondwana, such as recorded in Morocco. (2) Subsequently, during the late Hirnantian of Anticosti (uppermost Ellis Bay Formation), phytoplanktic communities suffered a crisis, exemplified by the disappearance of several typical, large Late Ordovician taxa (i.e., Orthosphaeridium spp., Peteinosphaeridium spp., large Baltisphaeridum spp., Sacculidium sp.). The lower Becscie strata, corresponding to the time of deglaciation at the O/S boundary interval, only contain a low diversity assemblage dominated by large acritarchs of the genus Hoegklintia and other morphologically related forms, and a few tolerant and long-ranging taxa (e.g., Evittia remota, Micrhystridium spp., leiospheres). Despite a possible taphonomic bias in the uppermost Ellis Bay Formation, the major crisis in the late Hirnantian coincides with the second $\delta$13C excursion and a second, stronger glacially-driven sea-level fall corresponding to the time of the maximum extend of the ice sheets on Gondwana. (3) Such phytoplankton events have also been detected in Gondwanan ice-center area, but with "typical Ordovician taxa crises" occurring apparently later when plotted against positive carbon isotope excursions, as also observed in Baltica. This time-lag may be linked to a basin configuration of the studied areas, where environmental stress consequently differed or linked to the presence of omission surfaces coupled with preservation bias of acritarch assemblages in the uppermost Ordovician strata of Anticosti. In addition to their biostratigraphic and palaeobiogeographic utility, acritarchs turn out to be more specific in highlighting palaeoenvironmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Thickness and facies variations in the Upper Ordovician succession of Anticosti Island have made correlations between the western and eastern ends of the island difficult. This chitinozoan study reveals that most strata of the Ellis Bay Formation at the eastern end of the island correlate with the Vaur{\'{e}}al Formation at the western end. In the eastern end, chitinozoans typical of the Ellis Bay Formation occur only in the upper part of the Lousy Cove Member, whereas chitinozoans diagnostic of the mid-upper Vaur{\'{e}}al occur in the rest of the formation. Moreover, the eastern Schmitt Creek and Mill Bay members of the Vaur{\'{e}}al Formation are older than the uppermost Vaur{\'{e}}al eponym members in the western end. New east-west correlations, supported by geochemical, sedimentological, and sequence stratigraphic data, are proposed. Comparison with coeval Upper Ordovician successions suggests a Hirnantian age for the gamachiana Zone that occurs in the lower members of the Ellis Bay Formation. It also indicates that the Hirnantian Iso topic Carbon Excursion (HICE) on Anticosti begins in the D. anceps Zone, just below the base of the Hirnantian Stage, reaches a first peak in the lower N. extraordinarius Zone, a second modest peak high in the N. extraordinarius Zone, and a third, more important one, in the lower part of the N. persculptus Zone.

abstract = {This study presents subdaily resolved chemical records through fossil mollusk shell calcite. Trace element profiles resolve periodic variability across $\sim$40-$\mu$m-thin daily growth laminae in a Campanian Torreites sanchezi rudist bivalve. These high-resolution records are combined with seasonally resolved stable isotope and trace element records that allow shell-chemical variability to be discussed on both seasonal and daily scale. A combination of layer counting, spectral analysis of chemical cyclicity and chemical layer counting shows that the rudist precipitated 372 daily laminae per year, demonstrating that length of day has increased since the Late Cretaceous, as predicted by astronomical models. This new approach to determine the length of a solar day in geologic history through multiproxy chemical records at subdaily resolution yields considerably more control on the uncertainty of this estimate. Daily chemical variability exceeds seasonal variability in our records, and cannot be explained by diurnal temperature changes. Instead, we postulate that rudist shell chemistry is driven on a daily scale by changes in light intensity. These results together with those of stable isotope analyses provide strong evidence that Torreites rudists had photosymbionts. Bivalve shell calcite generally preserves well. Therefore, this study paves the way for daily-scale reconstructions of paleoenvironment and sunlight intensity on geologic time scales from bivalve shells, potentially allowing researchers to bridge the gap between climate and weather reconstructions. Such reconstructions improve shell chronologies, document environmental change in warm ecosystems, and widen our understanding of the magnitude of short-term changes during greenhouse climates.},

abstract = {The clumped isotope ($\Delta$47) proxy is a promising geochemical tool to reconstruct past ocean temperatures far back in time and in unknown settings, due to its unique thermodynamic basis that renders it independent from other environmental factors like seawater composition. Although previously hampered by large sample-size requirements, recent methodological advances have made the paleoceanographic application of $\Delta$47 on small (<5 mg) foraminifer samples possible. Previous studies show a reasonable match between $\Delta$47 calibrations based on synthetic carbonate and various species of planktonic foraminifers. However, studies performed before recent methodological advances were based on relatively few species and data treatment that is now outdated. To overcome these limitations and elucidate species-specific effects, we analyzed 14 species of planktonic foraminifers in sediment surface samples from 13 sites, covering a growth temperature range of ∼0–28 °C. We selected mixed layer-dwelling and deep-dwelling species from a wide range of ocean settings to evaluate the feasibility of temperature reconstructions for different water depths. Various techniques to estimate foraminifer calcification temperatures were tested in order to assess their effects on the calibration and to find the most suitable approach. Results from this study generally confirm previous findings that there are no species-specific effects on the $\Delta$47-temperature relationship in planktonic foraminifers, with one possible exception. Various morphotypes of Globigerinoides ruber were found to often deviate from the general trend determined for planktonic foraminifers. Our data are in excellent agreement with a recent foraminifer calibration study that was performed with a different analytical setup, as well as with a calibration based exclusively on benthic foraminifers. A combined, methodologically homogenized dataset also reveals very good agreement with an inorganic calibration based on travertines. Our findings highlight the potential of the $\Delta$47 paleothermometer to be applied to recent and extinct species alike to study surface ocean temperatures as well as thermocline variability for a multitude of settings and time scales.},

abstract = {Sulfur isotopes measured from sedimentary rocks are used to reconstruct the global sulfur cycle and chemostratigraphic correlation. Relative and absolute changes in the sulfur isotopic composition of the ocean ($\delta$34Sseawater) are essential for estimating changes in redox conditions in ancient environments, particularly for geochemical models that utilize isotope mass balance. Thus, accurate estimates of $\delta$34Sseawater must be measured using a laboratory protocol optimized for the extraction of primary sulfate (preserved as carbonate-associated sulfate; CAS) by removing any contaminant secondary sulfate (e.g., from diagenetic pyrite oxidation). Here we use two CAS-extraction protocols on Lower–Middle Ordovician carbonate rocks to test the degree to which similar absolute values and stratigraphic trends in $\delta$34SCAS are produced by different CAS extraction methods. One method processes carbonate powders once with a single rinse of a 10% NaCl solution to remove sulfate minerals or weakly bonded sulfate ions, followed by a rinse in 5–6% bleach to remove organically bound sulfur before dissolution in hydrochloric acid (HCl). The second method treats carbonate powders with three rinses of NaCl, without a bleach rinse, to more aggressively remove secondary sulfate before dissolution in HCl. Isotopic results show that samples treated in three NaCl rinses produce $\delta$34SCAS values that are on average 7‰ more positive than samples treated with a single NaCl rinse, but a similar stratigraphic trend is preserved in samples processed with either method. We interpret the difference in $\delta$34SCAS between methods to reflect the incomplete removal of secondary sulfate derived from the oxidation of 32S-enriched pyrite when employing only a single NaCl rinse. Surprisingly, rocks with low CAS concentrations (≤10 mg/kg) using both methods show no significant difference in $\delta$34SCAS values, as well as no significant difference in pyrite concentrations and pyrite $\delta$34S ($\delta$34SPY) between methods. Samples with low CAS concentrations are likely altered and secondary sulfate sourced from pyrite oxidation has likely become incorporated into recrystallized carbonate minerals or incorporated into pore-filling calcite cement, all of which is captured as CAS. Results suggest that both CAS-extraction protocols can produce broadly similar $\delta$34SCAS trends, but a single NaCl rinse may not completely remove contaminant sulfate sorbed onto carbonate grains and thus will not yield meaningful data for reconstructing $\delta$34Sseawater. This has clear implications for modeling studies aimed at reconstructing paleo-redox conditions using $\delta$34S data assumed to record global $\delta$34Sseawater trends if these $\delta$34S data are generated using a non-optimized CAS protocol.},

The AMOC slows down considerably (by 20-40%) during the LGM as compared to the modern climate in four models, there is a slight reduction in one model and four models show a substantial increase in AMOC strength (by 10-40%). It is found that a major controlling factor for the AMOC response is the density contrast between Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) at their source regions. Changes in the density contrast are determined by the opposing effects of changes in temperature and salinity, with more saline AABW as compared to NADW consistently found in all models and less cooling of AABW in all models but one. In only two models is the AMOC response during the LGM directly related to the response in net evaporation over the Atlantic basin. Most models show large changes in the ocean freshwater transports into the basin, but this does not seem to affect the AMOC response. Finally, there is some dependence on the accuracy of the control state.},

abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Combining ocean models and proxy data via data assimilation is a powerful means to obtain more reliable estimates of past ocean states, but studies using data assimilation for paleo-ocean state estimation are rare. A few studies used the adjoint method, also called 4D-Var, to estimate the state of the ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The adjoint method, however, requires the adjoint of the model code, which is not easily obtained for most models. The method is computationally very demanding and does not readily provide uncertainty estimates. Here, we present a new and computationally very efficient technique to obtain ocean state estimates. We applied a state reduction approach in conjunction with a finite difference sensitivity-iterative Kalman smoother (FDS-IKS) to estimate spatially varying atmospheric forcing fields and to obtain an equilibrium model simulation in consistency with proxy data. We tested the method in synthetic pseudo-proxy data experiments. The method is capable of very efficiently estimating 16 control variables and reconstructing a target ocean circulation from sea surface temperature (SST) and oxygen isotopic composition of seawater data at LGM coverage. The method is advantageous over the adjoint method regarding that it is very easy to implement, it requires substantially less computing time and provides an uncertainty estimate of the estimated control variables. The computing time, however, depends linearly on the size of the control space limiting the number of control variables that can be estimated. We used the method to investigate the constraint of data outside of the Atlantic Ocean on the Atlantic overturning circulation. Our results indicate that while data from the Pacific or Indian Ocean aid in correctly estimating the Atlantic overturning circulation, they are not as crucial as the Atlantic data. We additionally applied the method to estimate the LGM ocean state constrained by a global SST reconstruction and data on the oxygen isotopic composition of calcite from fossil benthic and planktic foraminifera. The LGM estimate shows a large improvement compared to our first guess, but model-data misfits remain after the optimization due to model errors that cannot be corrected by the control variables. The estimate shows a shallower North Atlantic Deep Water and a weaker Atlantic overturning circulation compared to today in consistency with previous studies. The combination of the FDS-IKS and the state reduction approach is a step forward in making ocean state estimation and data assimilation applicable for complex and computationally expensive models and to models where the adjoint is not available.</p>},

The $\delta$<sup>13</sup>C of benthic foraminifera indicate the Atlantic Ocean was more chemically stratified during the LGM, but the nonconservative nature of $\delta$<sup>13</sup>C complicates interpretation of the LGM signal.

Our calculations suggest that the ratio was at least twice as large at the LGM. We speculate that the primary cause was reduced mixing between northern and southern component waters, associated with movement of this water mass boundary away from the zone of intense mixing near the seafloor. The shallower water mass boundary yields an order of magnitude increase in the volume of southern component water, suggesting its residence time may have increased substantially. Our analysis supports the idea that an expanded volume of Antarctic Bottom Water and limited vertical mixing enhanced the abyssal ocean's ability to trap carbon during glacial times. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The cores span water depths from about 400 to 3000 in and intersect the major water masses in this region. These new data fill a critical gap in the South Atlantic Ocean and provide the motivation for updating the classic glacial western Atlantic $\delta$13C transect of Duplessy et al. (1988). The distribution of $\delta$13C of ∑CO2 requires the presence of three distinct water masses in the glacial Atlantic Ocean: a shallow (∼1000 m), southern source water mass with an end-member $\delta$13C value of about 0.3-0.5% VPDB, a middepth (∼1500 m), northern source water mass with an end-member value of about 1.5‰, and a deep (>2000 m), southern source water with an end-member value of less than -0.2‰, and perhaps as low as the -0.9‰ values observed in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (Ninnemann and Charles, 2002). The origins of the water masses are supported by the meridional gradients in benthic foraminiferal $\delta$18O. A revised glacial section of deep water $\delta$13C documents the positions and gradients among these end-member intermediate and deep water masses. The large property gradients in the presence of strong vertical mixing can only be maintained by a vigorous overturning circulation. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

However, previous studies have resulted in contradictory results regarding the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and three-dimensional, quantitative reconstructions of the glacial ocean constrained by multiple proxies remain scarce. Here we simulate the modern and glacial ocean using a coupled physical-biogeochemical, global, three-dimensional model constrained simultaneously by $\delta$13C, radiocarbon, and $\delta$15N to explore the effects of AMOC differences and Southern Ocean iron fertilization on the distributions of these isotopes and ocean carbon storage. We show that $\delta$13C and radiocarbon data sparsely sampled at the locations of existing glacial sediment cores can be used to reconstruct the modern AMOC accurately. Applying this method to the glacial ocean we find that a surprisingly weak (6–9 Sv or about half of today's) and shallow AMOC maximizes carbon storage and best reproduces the sediment isotope data. Increasing the atmospheric soluble iron flux in the model's Southern Ocean intensifies export production, carbon storage, and further improves agreement with $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N reconstructions. Our best fitting simulation is a significant improvement compared with previous studies, and suggests that both circulation and export production changes were necessary to maximize carbon storage in the glacial ocean.},

abstract = {The Proterozoic Eon hosted the emergence and initial recorded diversification of eukaryotes. Oxygen levels in the shallow marine settings critical to these events were lower than today's, although how much lower is debated. Here, we use concentrations of iodate (the oxidized iodine species) in shallow-marine limestones and dolostones to generate the first comprehensive record of Proterozoic near-surface marine redox conditions. The iodine proxy is sensitive to both local oxygen availability and the relative proximity to anoxic waters. To assess the validity of our approach, Neogene–Quaternary carbonates are used to demonstrate that diagenesis most often decreases and is unlikely to increase carbonate-iodine contents. Despite the potential for diagenetic loss, maximum Proterozoic carbonate iodine levels are elevated relative to those of the Archean, particularly during the Lomagundi and Shuram carbon isotope excursions of the Paleo- and Neoproterozoic, respectively. For the Shuram anomaly, comparisons to Neogene–Quaternary carbonates suggest that diagenesis is not responsible for the observed iodine trends. The baseline low iodine levels in Proterozoic carbonates, relative to the Phanerozoic, are linked to a shallow oxic–anoxic interface. Oxygen concentrations in surface waters would have at least intermittently been above the threshold required to support eukaryotes. However, the diagnostically low iodine data from mid-Proterozoic shallow-water carbonates, relative to those of the bracketing time intervals, are consistent with a dynamic chemocline and anoxic waters that would have episodically mixed upward and laterally into the shallow oceans. This redox instability may have challenged early eukaryotic diversification and expansion, creating an evolutionary landscape unfavorable for the emergence of animals.},

Here we explore the application of iodine/calcium ratios (I/Ca) in marine carbonate as a new geochemical proxy to constrain seawater redox change, and provide additional insights into the response of ocean chemistry to ancient climatic warming. Iodine has long been known as a redox-sensitive and biophilic element, mainly present as iodate and iodide in seawater, iodate converting to iodide under anoxic conditions. Laboratory experiments growing calcite crystals from solutions spiked with iodate show that this is the ionic species incorporated into the carbonate structure, likely substituting for the CO32- ion. A fall in the I/Ca ratio measured in carbonates formed in shallow water by marine calcifiers during the early Toarcian and Cenomanian-Turonian OAEs is interpreted both as a response to a decrease in the iodate/iodide ratio in ocean waters and the drawdown of the global iodine inventory under conditions of accelerated organic-matter burial. The results suggest that I/Ca ratios in carbonates may be used to monitor seawater oxidation levels throughout Earth history. {\textcopyright} 2010 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The end-Devonian mass extinction ($\sim$359 Ma) substantially impacted marine ecosystems and shaped the roots of modern vertebrate biodiversity. Although multiple hypotheses have been proposed, no consensus has been reached about the mechanism inducing this extinction event. In this study, I/Ca ratio of carbonate was used to unravel the changes in local oxygen content of the upper water column during this critical interval. The Devonian-Carboniferous boundary was recorded in two shallow water carbonate sections in south China. I/Ca values at both locations show a clear decline in the Middle and Upper Siphonodella praesulcata conodont zones, which coincides with a positive shift in carbonate carbon isotope composition and a negative shift in nitrogen isotope composition. These results suggest that deoxygenation was intensified during this critical interval, which likely influenced shallow water habitats, lending support to the notion that oxygen deficiency likely was a direct mechanism impacting the end-Devonian mass extinction.},

abstract = {Abstract. A computationally efficient, intermediate complexity ocean-atmosphere-sea ice model (C-GOLDSTEIN) has been incorporated into the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system modelling (GENIE) framework. This involved decoupling of the three component modules that were re-coupled in a modular way, to allow replacement with alternatives and coupling of further components within the framework. The climate model described here (referred to as "eb_go_gs" for short) is the most basic version of GENIE in which atmosphere, ocean and sea ice all play an active role. Among improvements on the original C-GOLDSTEIN model, latitudinal grid resolution is generalized to allow a wider range of surface grids to be used. The ocean, atmosphere and sea-ice components of the "eb_go_gs" configuration of GENIE are individually described, along with details of their coupling. The setup and results from simulations using four different meshes are presented. The four alternative meshes comprise the widely-used 36 × 36 equal-area-partitioning of the Earth surface with 16 depth layers in the ocean, a version in which horizontal and vertical resolution are doubled, a setup matching the horizontal resolution of the dynamic atmospheric component available in the GENIE framework, and a setup with enhanced resolution in high-latitude areas. Results are presented for a spin-up experiment with a baseline parameter set and wind forcing typically used for current studies in which "eb_go_gs" is coupled with the ocean biogeochemistry module of GENIE, as well as for an experiment with a modified parameter set, revised wind forcing, and additional cross-basin transport pathways (Indonesian and Bering Strait throughflows). The latter experiment is repeated with the four mesh variants, with common parameter settings throughout, except for time-step length. Selected state variables and diagnostics are compared in two regards: (i) between simulations at lowest resolution that are obtained with the baseline and modified configurations, predominantly in order to evaluate the revision of the wind forcing, the modification of some key parameters, and the effect of additional transport pathways across the Arctic Ocean and the Indonesian Archipelago; (ii) between simulations with the four meshes, in order to explore various effects of mesh choice.},

abstract = {A simplified climate model is presented which includes a fully 3-D, frictional geostrophic (FG) ocean component but retains an integration efficiency considerably greater than extant climate models with 3-D, primitive-equation ocean representations (20 kyears of integration can be completed in about a day on a PC). The model also includes an Energy and Moisture Balance atmosphere and a dynamic and thermodynamic sea-ice model. Using a semi-random ensemble of 1,000 simulations, we address both the inverse problem of parameter estimation, and the direct problem of quantifying the uncertainty due to mixing and transport parameters. Our results represent a first attempt at tuning a 3-D climate model by a strictly defined procedure, which nevertheless considers the whole of the appropriate parameter space. Model estimates of meridional overturning and Atlantic heat transport are well reproduced, while errors are reduced only moderately by a doubling of resolution. Model parameters are only weakly constrained by data, while strong correlations between mean error and parameter values are mostly found to be an artefact of single-parameter studies, not indicative of global model behaviour. Single-parameter sensitivity studies can therefore be misleading. Given a single, illustrative scenario of CO2 increase and fixing the polynomial coefficients governing the extremely simple radiation parameterisation, the spread of model predictions for global mean warming due solely to the transport parameters is around one degree after 100 years forcing, although in a typical 4,000-year ensemble-member simulation, the peak rate of warming in the deep Pacific occurs 400 years after the onset of the forcing. The corresponding uncertainty in Atlantic overturning after 100 years is around 5 Sv, with a small, but non-negligible, probability of a collapse in the long term. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {Sea surface and subsurface temperatures over large parts of the ocean during the Eocene epoch (55.5- 33.7 Ma) exceeded modern values by several degrees, which must have affected a number of oceanic processes. Here, we focus on the effect of elevated water column temperatures on the efficiency of the biological pump, particularly in relation to carbon and nutrient cycling. We use stable isotope values from exceptionally well-preserved planktonic foraminiferal calcite from Tanzania and Mexico to reconstruct vertical carbon isotope gradients in the upper water column, exploiting the fact that individual species lived and calcified at different depths. The oxygen isotope ratios of different species' tests are used to estimate the temperature of calcification, which we converted to absolute depths using Eocene temperature profiles generated by general circulation models. This approach, along with potential pitfalls, is illustrated using data from modern core-top assemblages from the same area. Our results indicate that, during the Early and Middle Eocene, carbon isotope gradients were steeper (and larger) through the upper thermocline than in the modern ocean. This is consistent with a shallower average depth of organic matter remineralization and supports previously proposed hypotheses that invoke high metabolic rates in a warm Eocene ocean, leading to more efficient recycling of organic matter and reduced burial rates of organic carbon.},

abstract = {The middle Cretaceous was a period characterized by elevated sea-floor spreading rates, enhanced volcanism, high atmospheric CO2 levels, warming temperatures, and the peak eustatic highstand of the Mesozoic. Two well-known perturbations in the global carbon cycle mark this interval – the Cenomanian-Turonian Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2) and the Mid-Cenomanian Event (MCE). Although studies during the past two decades have arrived at a consensus that the Caribbean Large Igneous Province (LIP) likely played a key role in triggering OAE2, arguably the most significant perturbation of the Late Cretaceous, the detailed environmental developments during the Mid-Late Cenomanian leading up to it have only recently been the focus of investigations. This study, based on previous studies of the Middle Cenomanian – Early Turonian climate, tectonics, sea level, and carbon isotope chemostratigraphy, tests plausible environmental scenarios to explain the behavior of the Middle Cenomanian to Early Turonian carbon cycle, via isotope-mass balance calculation in a simple carbon cycle box model. The model experiments successfully reproduce two distinctive features observed in the Mid-Late Cenomanian $\delta$13C curves - 1) decoupling of $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg reflecting increasing isotope fractionation in response to steadily rising pCO2, driven by enhanced volcanic degassing of mantle-derived CO2, which likely preceded the presumed peak volcanism of the Caribbean LIP; and 2) a long-lived, secondary positive excursion that documents enhanced organic carbon burial in shallow shelf seas that expanded during global sea-level rise and highstand. We demonstrate a plausible combination of environmental forcings that pre-conditioned the mid-Cretaceous ocean-atmosphere system for a massive perturbation, OAE2.},

abstract = {The elevation history of the Himalaya-Tibet orogen is central to understanding the evolution and dynamics of both the India-Asia collision and the Asian monsoons. The surface elevation history of the region is largely deduced from stable isotope ($\delta$ 18 O, $\delta$D) paleoaltimetry. This method is based on the observed relationship between the isotopic composition of meteoric waters ($\delta$ 18 O p , $\delta$D p ) and surface elevation, and the assumption that precipitation undergoes Rayleigh distillation under forced ascent. Here we evaluate how elevation-induced climate change influences the $\delta$ 18 Op-elevation relationship and whether Rayleigh distillation is the dominant process affecting $\delta$ 18 O p . We use an isotope-enabled climate model, ECHAM-wiso, to show that the Rayleigh distillation process is only dominant in the monsoonal regions of the Himalayas when the mountains are high. When the orogen is lowered, local surface recycling and convective processes become important, as forced ascent is weakened due to weaker Asian monsoons. As a result, the $\delta$ 18 O p lapse rate in the Himalayas increases from around -3 to above -0.1‰km, and has little relationship with elevation. On the Tibetan Plateau, the meridional gradient of $\delta$ 18 O decreases from ∼ 1 to ∼ 0.3‰ o-1 with reduced elevation, primarily due to enhanced sub-cloud reevaporation under lower relative humidity. Overall, we report that using $\delta$ 18 O p or $\delta$D p to deduce surface elevation change in the Himalayan-Tibetan region has severe limitations and demonstrate that the processes that control annual-mean precipitation-weighted $\delta$ 18 O p vary by region and with surface elevation. In summary, we determine that the application of $\delta$ 18 O paleoaltimetry is only appropriate for 7 of the 50 sites from which $\delta$ 18 O records have been used to infer past elevations.},

abstract = {The existence of stabilizing feedbacks within Earth's climate system is generally thought to be necessary for the persistence of liquid water and life. Over the course of Earth's history, Earth's atmospheric composition appears to have adjusted to the gradual increase in solar luminosity, resulting in persistently habitable surface temperatures. With limited exceptions, the Earth system has been observed to recover rapidly from pulsed climatic perturbations. Carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation via negative feedbacks within the coupled global carbon‐silica cycles are classically viewed as the main processes giving rise to climate stability on Earth. Here we review the long‐term global carbon cycle budget, and how the processes modulating Earth's climate system have evolved over time. Specifically, we focus on the relative roles that shifts in carbon sources and sinks have played in driving long‐term changes in atmospheric pCO2. We make the case that marine processes are an important component of the canonical silicate weathering feedback, and have played a much more important role in pCO2 regulation than traditionally imagined. Notably, geochemical evidence indicate that the weathering of marine sediments and off‐axis basalt alteration act as major carbon sinks. However, this sink was potentially dampened during Earth's early history when oceans had higher levels of dissolved silicon (Si), iron (Fe), and magnesium (Mg), and instead likely fostered more extensive carbon recycling within the ocean‐atmosphere system via reverse weathering—that in turn acted to elevate ocean‐atmosphere CO2 levels.},

abstract = {Organic carbon burial is an important driver of carbon cycle and climate dynamics on geological and shorter time scales. Ocean basins emerging during the Early Cretaceous break-up of Gondwana were primary sites of organic carbon burial, implying that their tectonic and oceanographic evolution may have affected trends and perturbations in global climate via changes in local organic carbon burial. Assessing the role of individual ocean basins in the global carbon-climate context requires a sound understanding of the processes that induced large-scale changes in carbon burial and the timing of these changes. Here we reconstruct the oceanographic evolution, and its links to organic carbon burial, in the Barremian to Albian South Atlantic and Southern Ocean basins, which may have acted as carbon sinks of global importance. Our reconstruction is based on combined seawater neodymium isotope and sedimentological records obtained from multiple deep sea drill sites and a new general circulation model. Deep water circulation within and between those basins was primarily controlled by the opening of the shallow Falkland Plateau Gateway (between ∼118 Ma and ∼113 Ma) and the deep Georgia Basin Gateway (by ∼110 Ma), for which we provide new age constraints based on biostratigraphic and carbon isotope data. The opening of these gateways was accompanied by local to basin-wide decreases in organic carbon burial, suggesting that ocean circulation affected the oxygenation state via changes in deep water ventilation. Although our data do not provide quantitative information on the impact of changes in regional organic carbon burial on the global carbon cycle, the synchronicity between the reduction of organic carbon burial in the South Atlantic basin and global warming during the Early Albian points to a strong causal relationship.},

abstract = {Established theories ascribe much of the observed long-term Cenozoic climate cooling to atmospheric carbon consumption by erosion and weathering of tectonically uplifted terrains, but climatic effects due to changes in magmatism and carbon degassing are also involved. At timescales comparable to those of Milankovitch cycles, late Cenozoic building/melting of continental ice sheets, erosion, and sea level changes can affect magmatism, which provides an opportunity to explore possible feedbacks between climate and volcanic changes. Existing data show that extinction of Neo-Tethyan volcanic arcs is largely synchronous with phases of atmospheric carbon reduction, suggesting waning degassing as a possible contribution to climate cooling throughout the early to middle Cenozoic. In addition, the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the last deglaciation may be ascribed to enhanced volcanism and carbon emissions due to unloading of active magmatic provinces on continents. The deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2 points to a mutual feedback between climate and volcanism mediated by the redistribution of surface masses and carbon emissions. This may explain the progression to higher amplitude and increasingly asymmetric cycles of late Cenozoic climate oscillations. Unifying theories relating tectonic, erosional, climatic, and magmatic changes across timescales via the carbon cycle offer an opportunity for future research into the coupling between surface and deep Earth processes.},

Dating by 14C permits the estimation of sediment accumulation rates in the Holocene. In the ancient outcrops, the timing is given by cyclostratigraphic analysis. Elementary depositional sequences formed in tune with the 20-ka precession cycle, although much of this time may have been spent in non-deposition and/or erosion. After decompaction of the ancient sequences, their accumulation rates can be evaluated. It is suggested that the studied Holocene sediments accumulated over the past 6000 years with rates of 0.3 to 3 mm/a, whereas the Kimmeridgian and Berriasian facies show somewhat lower rates of 0.07 to 0.6 mm/a. This difference may be due to methodological errors, but also to variable carbonate production. In shallow carbonate systems, much of the sediment produced may be redistributed over the platform or exported. Furthermore, basin morphology and currents can strongly influence facies and thickness of the accumulated sediment. Finally, the accumulated sediment may suffer further erosion before it is preserved in the sedimentary record. Consequently, when estimating sedimentation rates in ancient sequences, it is important to do this with the highest time resolution possible, and only after having decompacted the sediment and evaluated the time lost in hiatuses or condensed intervals.},

abstract = {The unprecedented diversifications in the fossil record of the early Palaeozoic (541–419 million years ago) increased both within-sample ($\alpha$) and global ($\gamma$) diversity, generating considerable ecological complexity. Faunal difference ($\beta$ diversity), including spatial heterogeneity, is thought to have played a major role in early Palaeozoic marine diversification, although $\alpha$ diversity is the major determinant of $\gamma$ diversity through the Phanerozoic. Drivers for this Phanerozoic shift from $\beta$ to $\alpha$ diversity are not yet resolved. Here, we evaluate the impacts of environmental and faunal heterogeneity on diversity patterns using a global spatial grid. We present early Palaeozoic genus-level $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ diversity curves for molluscs, brachiopods, trilobites and echinoderms and compare them with measures of spatial lithological heterogeneity, which is our proxy for environmental heterogeneity. We find that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity are associated with increased lithological heterogeneity, and that $\beta$ diversity declines over time while $\alpha$ increases. We suggest that the enhanced dispersal of marine taxa from the Middle Ordovician onwards facilitated increases in $\alpha$ diversity by encouraging the occupation of narrow niches and increasing the prevalence of transient species, simultaneously reducing spatial $\beta$ diversity.

abstract = {The marine invertebrate fossil record provides the most comprehensive history of how the diversity of animal life has evolved through time. One of the main features of this record is a modest rise in diversity over nearly a half-billion years. The long-standing view is that ecological interactions such as resource competition and predation set upper limits to global diversity, which, in the absence of external perturbations, is maintained indefinitely at equilibrium. However, the effect of mechanisms associated with the history of the seafloor, and their influence on the creation and destruction of marine benthic habitats, has not been explored. Here we use statistical methods for causal inference to investigate the drivers of marine invertebrate diversity dynamics through the Phanerozoic. We find that diversity dynamics responded to secular variations in marine food supply, substantiating the idea that global species richness is regulated by resource availability. Once diversity was corrected for changes in food resource availability, its dynamics were causally linked to the age of the subducting oceanic crust. We suggest that the time elapsed between the formation (at mid-ocean ridges) and destruction (at subduction zones) of ocean basins influences the diversity dynamics of marine invertebrates and may have contributed to constrain their diversification.},

abstract = {Sequence stratigraphy has been applied in a wide range of scales of time and space, from decimeter-thick layers formed within hours to kilometer-thick basin fills formed during hundreds of millions of years. The traditional approach to practice sequence stratigraphy in this wide range of scales is to subdivide the sediment piles into an ordered hierarchy of sequence cycles of different duration and different architecture. An alternative are scale-invariant models with fractal characteristics. Published data confirm two predictions of the ordered-hierarchy model: sequences of very short duration (<1 × 103 years) are parasequences bounded by flooding surfaces, very long sequences (>200 × 106 years) are symmetrical transgressive-regressive cycles. However, the sequence record in the range of 1 × 104-200 × 106 years, the principal domain of sequence stratigraphy, shows a rather irregular succession of sequences with variable symmetry and bounded by flooding surfaces or exposure surfaces. For these time scales, scale-invariant models are a good first approximation, particularly because the evidence for scale-invariance and randomness in the stratigraphic record is strong: Frequency spectra of sea-level change as well as rates of sedimentation and rates of accommodation change plotted against length of observation span show basic trends indistinguishable from random walk. These trends, combined with scale-invariant sequence models may be the most efficient tools for across-the-board predictions on sequences and for locating islands of order in the sequence record. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

abstract = {A review of biodiversity curves of marine organisms indicates that, despite fluctuations in amplitude (some large), a large-scale, long-term radiation of life took place during the early Palaeozoic Era; it was aggregated by a succession of more discrete and regionalized radiations across geographies and within phylogenies. This major biodiversification within the marine biosphere started during late Precambrian time and was only finally interrupted in the Devonian Period. It includes both the Cambrian Explosion and the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event. The establishment of modern marine ecosystems took place during a continuous chronology of the successive establishment of organisms and their ecological communities, developed during the 'Cambrian substrate revolution', the 'Ordovician plankton revolution', the 'Ordovician substrate revolution', the 'Ordovician bioerosion revolution' and the 'Devonian nekton revolution'. At smaller scales, different regional but important radiations can be recognized geographically and some of them have been identified and named (e.g. those associated with the 'Richmondian Invasion' during Late Ordovician time in Laurentia and the contemporaneous 'Boda event' in parts of Europe and North Africa), in particular from areas that were in or moved towards lower latitudes, allowing high levels of speciation on epicontintental seas during these intervals. The datasets remain incomplete for many other geographical areas, but also for particular time intervals (e.g. during the late Cambrian 'Furongian Gap'). The early Palaeozoic biodiversification therefore appears to be a long-term process, modulated by bursts in significant diversity and intervals of inadequate data, where its progressive character will become increasingly clearer with the availability of more complete datasets, with better global coverage and more advanced analytical techniques.},

abstract = {A series of oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) occurred in the mid-Cretaceous warm period (120&#8211;80 Ma) that have been linked with high rates of organic carbon burial, warm high- and low- latitude temperatures, and sea-level changes. OAEs have been studied individually, but a causal mechanism that connects them has been lacking. We show that peaks in phosphorus accumulation in marine sediments broadly coincide with OAEs 1a, 1b, 1d, 2, and 3, and exhibit a 5&#8211;6 Myr periodicity, which for reactive-P is prominent over 100&#8211;80 Ma. Oxic-anoxic oscillations of this frequency are also found in a model of the coupled N, P, C, and O2 biogeochemical cycles. These oscillations are maintained by positive feedbacks between phosphate concentration, biological productivity, and anoxia in the global ocean and counteracting, but slower, negative feedbacks involving changes in atmospheric oxygen. An increase in phosphorus weathering rate above a critical threshold can shift the system into self-sustaining oscillation. This could have been caused by tectonic and volcanic forcing increasing atmospheric CO2 and global warmth 120&#8211;80 Ma, augmented by the rise of flowering plants around 100 Ma. With a plausible forcing scenario, we are able to reproduce the approximate timing of OAEs 1a, 1b, 1d, 2, and 3 in the model.},

abstract = {Ordovician atmospheric CO2 level was an important influence on climate and life. However, modelled estimates of Ordovician CO2 differ widely and, in contrast to much of the subsequent Phanerozoic, they lack fossil proxy constraints. In vivo cyanobacterial sheath calcification, promoted by carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), creates distinctive microfossils. These provide a direct ecophysiological link to ambient concentrations of CO2 and, to a lesser extent, O2. Cyanobacteria do not calcify at high CO2 concentrations. Experiments show that CCMs can be induced in present-day cyanobacteria at CO2 levels below ∼10 times present atmospheric level (PAL) and that this promotes sheath calcification. We compiled a global database of cyanobacterial calcification in marine environments throughout the Ordovician (485-443 Myr ago) and compared it with modelled estimates of atmospheric CO2 and O2. These data show that many genera of marine calcified cyanobacteria reappeared from Cambrian Series 2 or first appeared globally during the late middle to late Upper Ordovician (late Darriwilian to late Katian) in carbonate platform facies, resulting in a previously unrecognized ten-fold increase in global diversity. Such a large increase in calcification suggests widespread induction of CCM expression in cyanobacteria, consistent with sustained decline in external CO2 concentrations below ∼10× PAL, together with increase in dissolved O2 level, during the late Darriwilian, Sandbian and Katian stages, ∼460-445 Myr ago. These cyanobacterial calcification fossil proxy data provide a first order constraint on modelled estimates of atmospheric CO2 for the Ordovician. Estimated CO2 outputs from COPSE and recent GEOCARB-based models are broadly consistent with this cyanobacterial calcification proxy for the Ordovician. In view of the long history of cyanobacteria, the calcified cyanobacterial proxy offers potential to assist interpretation of CO2 deeper into geological time.},

abstract = {Conflicting published interpretations of marine redox conditions during the Ordovician-Silurian transition (OST) may have been linked to spatial redox heterogeneity during this interval. However, details of the pattern of redox heterogeneity and its underlying causes remain unclear. Here, we present a high-resolution geochemical study of a drillcore section (Pengye #1) from Pengshui County (Chongqing municipality, southwestern China) that was located in the semi-restricted inner Yangtze Sea during the OST. We analyzed Fe-speciation, redox-sensitive trace elements, major elements, and pyrite $\delta$34S compositions ($\delta$34Spy) and then compared these data with published results from coeval sections at Datianba and Shuanghe in the same basin. The integrated dataset demonstrates pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity of redox conditions—especially the local development of euxinic conditions in the inner Yangtze Sea during the OST. Integrated data further suggest that high primary productivity and ample Fe fluxes in the inner Yangtze Sea may have depleted dissolved sulfate through microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) and subsequent pyrite formation, except in areas with enhanced sulfate supply from continental weathering or open-ocean exchange, which varied as a function of both tectonic (i.e., the regional Kwangsian Orogeny) and eustatic changes (i.e., the global Hirnantian glaciation). Limited sulfate availability thus likely prevented the development of euxinic conditions in some regions of the inner Yangtze Sea, as reflected in spatial variation of $\delta$34Spy. Our study highlights the potential role of sulfate availability on the development of watermass euxinia in semi-restricted marginal-marine basins during the OST.},

We propose a methodology based on forward-modeling approaches to test the validity of common exploration assumptions (e.g., chronostratigraphic value of seismic reflectors) and of geologic interpretations (e.g., stratigraphic correlations and depositional and diagenetic architecture) that are determined from a limited amount of data. The proposed workflow includes four main steps: (1) identification and quantification of the primary controls on carbonate deposition and the prediction of the carbonate stratigraphic architecture (through stratigraphic forward modeling); (2) identification of diagenetic processes and prediction of the spatial distribution of diagenetic products (diagenetic forward modeling); (3) quantification of the impact of diagenesis on acoustic and reservoir properties; and (4) computation of synthetic seismic models based on various scenarios of stratigraphic and diagenetic architectures and comparison with actual seismic. The likelihood of a given scenario is tested by quantifying the misfit between the modeled versus the real seismic. This workflow illustrates the relevance of forward-modeling approaches for building realistic models that can be shared by the various disciplines of carbonate exploration (sedimentology, stratigraphy, diagenesis, seismic, geomodeling, and reservoir).},

abstract = {CO 2 is considered the main greenhouse gas involved in the current global warming and the primary driver of temperature throughout Earth's history. However, the soundness of this relationship across time scales and during different climate states of the Earth remains uncertain. Here we explore how CO 2 and temperature are related in the framework of a Greenhouse climate state of the Earth. We reconstruct the long-term evolution of atmospheric CO 2 concentration (pCO 2 ) throughout the Cretaceous from the carbon isotope compositions of the fossil conifer Frenelopsis. We show that pCO 2 was in the range of ca. 150-650 ppm during the Barremian-Santonian interval, far less than what is usually considered for the mid Cretaceous. Comparison with available temperature records suggest that although CO 2 may have been a main driver of temperature and primary production at kyr or smaller scales, it was a long-term consequence of the climate-biological system, being decoupled or even showing inverse trends with temperature, at Myr scales. Our analysis indicates that the relationship between CO 2 and temperature is time scale-dependent at least during Greenhouse climate states of the Earth and that primary productivity is a key factor to consider in both past and future analyses of the climate system.},

abstract = {In ancient hothouses lacking ice sheets, the origins of large, million-year (myr)-scale sea-level oscillations remain a mystery, challenging current models of sea-level change. To address this mystery, we develop a sedimentary noise model for sea-level changes that simultaneously estimates geologic time and sea level from astronomically forced marginal marine stratigraphy. The noise model involves two complementary approaches: dynamic noise after orbital tuning (DYNOT) and lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient ($\rho$ 1 ). Noise modeling of Lower Triassic marine slope stratigraphy in South China reveal evidence for global sea-level variations in the Early Triassic hothouse that are anti-phased with continental water storage variations in the Germanic Basin. This supports the hypothesis that long-period (1-2 myr) astronomically forced water mass exchange between land and ocean reservoirs is a missing link for reconciling geological records and models for sea-level change during non-glacial periods.},

abstract = {Abstract. Biodiversity of phytoplankton is important for ecosystem stability and marine biogeochemistry. However, the large scale patterns of diversity are not well understood, and are often poorly characterized in terms of statistical relationships with environmental factors (e.g. latitude, temperature, productivity). Here we use ecological theory and a global trait-based ecosystem model to provide mechanistic understanding of patterns of phytoplankton diversity. Our study suggests that phytoplankton diversity across three dimensions of trait space (size, biogeochemical function, and thermal tolerance) is controlled by a disparate combinations of drivers: the supply rate of the limiting resource, the imbalance in different resource supplies relative to competing phytoplanktons' demands, size-selective grazing, and transport by the moving ocean. Using sensitivity studies we show that each dimension of diversity is controlled by different drivers. Models including only one (or two) of the trait dimensions will have different patterns of diversity than one which incorporates another trait dimension. We use the results of our theory/model exploration to infer the controls on the diversity patterns derived from field observations in meridional transects of the Atlantic and to explain why different taxa and size classes have differing patterns. These results suggest that it is unlikely that any single or even combination of environmental variables will be able to explain patterns of diversity.},

abstract = {This report summarizes the international divisions and ages in the Geologic Time Scale, published in 2012 (GTS2012). Since 2004, when GTS2004 was detailed, major developments have taken place that directly bear and have considerable impact on the intricate science of geologic time scaling. Precam brian now has a detailed proposal for chronostratigraphic subdivision instead of an outdated and abstract chronometric one. Of 100 chronostratigraphic units in the Phanerozoic 63 now have formal definitions, but stable chronostratigraphy in part of upper Paleozoic, Triassic and Middle Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous is still wanting. Detailed age calibration now exist between radiometric methods and orbital tuning, making 40Ar-39Ar dates 0.64% older and more accurate. In general, numeric uncertainty in the time scale, although complex and not entirely amenable to objective analysis, is improved and reduced. Bases of Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic are bracketed by analytically precise ages, respectively 541 ± 0.63, 252.16 ± 0.5, and 65.95 ± 0.05 Ma. High-resolution, direct age-dates now exist for base-Carboniferous, base-Permian, base-Jurassic, base-Cenomanian and base-Eocene. Relative to GTS2004, 26 of 100 time scale boundaries have changed age, of which 14 have changed more than 4 Ma, and 4 (in Middle to Late Triassic) between 6 and 12 Ma. There is much higher stratigraphic resolution in Late Carboniferous, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Paleogene, and improved integration with stable isotopes stratigraphy. Cenozoic and Cretaceous have a refined magneto-biochronology. The spectacular outcrop sections for the Rosello Composite in Sicily, Italy and at Zumaia, Basque Province, Spain encompass the Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points for two Pliocene and two Paleocene stages. Since the cycle record indicates, to the best of our knowledge that the stages sediment fill is stratigraphically complete, these sections also may fulfill the important role of stage unit stratotypes for three of these stages, Piacenzian, Zanclean and Danian. {\textcopyright} 2012 Gebr{\"{u}}der Borntraeger, Stuttgart, Germany.},

abstract = {Many aspects of deep-time Earth System models, including mantle convection, paleoclimatology, paleobiogeography and the deep Earth carbon cycle, require high-resolution plate motion models that include the evolution of the mosaic of plate boundaries through time. We present the first continuous late Paleozoic to present-day global plate model with evolving plate boundaries, building on and extending two previously published models for the late Paleozoic (410–250 Ma) and Mesozoic-Cenozoic (230–0 Ma). We ensure continuity during the 250–230 Ma transition period between the two models, update the absolute reference frame of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic model and add a new Paleozoic reconstruction for the Baltica-derived Alexander Terrane, now accreted to western North America. This 410–0 Ma open access model provides a framework for deep-time whole Earth modelling and acts as a base for future extensions and refinement. We analyse the model in terms of the number of plates, predicted plate size distribution, plate and continental root mean square (RMS) speeds, plate velocities and trench migration through time. Overall model trends share many similarities to those for recent times, which we use as a first order benchmark against which to compare the model and identify targets for future model refinement. Except for during the period $\sim$ 260–160 Ma, the number of plates (16–46) and ratio of “large” plates (≥ 107.5 km2) to smaller plates ($\sim$ 2.7–6.6) are fairly similar to present-day values (46 and 6.6, respectively), with lower values occurring during late Paleozoic assembly and growth of Pangea. This temporal pattern may also reflect difficulties in reconstructing small, now subducted oceanic plates further back in time, as well as whether a supercontinent is assembling or breaking up. During the $\sim$ 260–160 Ma timeframe the model reaches a minima in the number of plates, in contrast to what we would expect during initial Pangea breakup and thus highlighting the need for refinement of the relative plate motion model. Continental and plate RMS speeds show an overall increase backwards through time from $\sim$ 200 to 365 Ma, reaching a peak at 365 Ma of > 14 and > 16 cm/yr, respectively, compared to $\sim$ 3 and $\sim$ 5 cm/yr, respectively, at present-day. The median value of trench motion remains close to, yet above 0 cm/yr for most of the model timeframe, with a dominance in positive values reflecting a prevalence of trench retreat over advance. Trench advance speeds are excessive during the 370–160 Ma period, reaching more than four times that observed at present-day. Extended periods of trench advance and global continental and plate RMS speeds that far exceed present-day values warrant further investigation. Future work should test whether alternative absolute reference frames or relative motions would mitigate these high speeds, while still being consistent with geologic and geophysical observations, or alternatively focus on identifying potential driving mechanisms to account for such rapid motions.},

abstract = {Deep-sea carbonate represents Earth's largest carbon sink and one of the least-known components of the long-term carbon cycle that is intimately linked to climate. By coupling the deep-sea carbonate sedimentation history to a global tectonic model, we quantify this component within the framework of a continuously evolving seafloor. A long-term increase in marine carbonate carbon flux since the mid-Cretaceous is dominated by a post-50 Ma doubling of carbonate accumulation to $\sim$310 Mt C/yr at present-day. This increase was caused largely by the immense growth in deep-sea carbonate carbon storage, post-dating the end of the Early Eocene Climate Optimum. We suggest that a combination of a retreat of epicontinental seas, underpinned by long-term deepening of the seafloor, the inception of major Himalayan river systems, and the weathering of the Deccan Traps drove enhanced delivery of Ca2+ and HCO3- into the oceans and atmospheric CO2 drawdown in the 15 m.y. prior to the onset of glaciation at ca. 35 Ma. Relatively stagnant mid-ocean ridge, riftand subduction-related degassing during this period support our contention that continental silicate weathering, rather than a major decrease in CO2 degassing, may have triggered an increase in marine carbonate accumulation and long-term Eocene global cooling. Our results provide new constraints for global carbon cycle models, and may improve our understanding of carbonate subduction-related metamorphism, mineralization and isotopic signatures of degassing.},

abstract = {Subduction is a fundamental mechanism of material exchange between the planetary interior and the surface. Despite its significance, our current understanding of fluctuating subducting plate area and slab volume flux has been limited to a range of proxy estimates. Here we present a new detailed quantification of subduction zone parameters from the Late Triassic to present day (230–0 Ma). We use a community plate motion model with evolving plate topologies to extract trench-normal convergence rates through time to compute subducting plate areas, and we use seafloor paleo-age grids to estimate the thickness of subducting lithosphere to derive the slab flux through time. Our results imply that slab flux doubled to values greater than 500 km3/yr from 180 Ma in the Jurassic to 130 Ma in the mid-Cretaceous, subsequently halving again towards the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, largely driven by subduction zones rimming the Pacific ocean basin. The 130 Ma spike can be attributed to a two-fold increase in mid-ocean ridge lengths following the break-up of Pangea, and a coincident increase in convergence rates, with average speeds exceeding 10 cm/yr. With one third of the total 230 - 0 Ma subducted volume entering the mantle during this short ∼50 Myr period, we suggest this slab superflux drove a surge in slab penetration into the lower mantle and an associated increase in the vigour of mantle return flow. This mid-Cretaceous event may have triggered, or at least contributed to, the formation of the Darwin Rise mantle superswell, dynamic uplift of the South African Plateau and the plume pulse that produced the Ontong-Java-Hikurangi-Manihiki and Kerguelen plateaus, among others. The models presented here contribute to an improved understanding of the time-evolving flux of material consumed by subduction, and suggest that slab superflux may be a general feature of continental dispersal following supercontinent breakup. These insights may be useful for better understanding how supercontinent cycles are related to transient episodes of Large Igneous Province and superswell formation, and the associated deep cycling of minerals and volatiles, as well as leading to a better understanding of tectonic drivers of long-term climate and icehouse-to-greenhouse transitions.},

abstract = {The Earth's climate over the past million years has been characterized by a succession of cold and warm periods, known as glacial-interglacial cycles, with periodicities corresponding to those of the Earth's main orbital parameters; precession (23 kyr), obliquity (41 kyr) and eccentricity (100 kyr). The astronomical theory of climate, in which the orbital variations are taken to drive the climate changes, has been very successful in explaining many features of the palaeoclimate records. Nevertheless, the timing of the main glacial and interglacial periods remains puzzling in many respects. In particular, the main glacial-interglacial switches occur approximately every 100 kyr, but the changes in insolation forcing are very small in this frequency band. Similarly, an especially warm interglacial episode, about 400,000 years ago, occurred at a time when insolation variations were minimal. Here I propose that multiple equilibria in the climate system can provide a resolution of these problems within the framework of astronomical theory. I present two simple models that successfully simulate each glacial- interglacial cycle over the late Pleistocene epoch at the correct time and with approximately the correct amplitude. Moreover, in a simulation over the past 2 million years, the onset of the observed prominent $\sim$100-kyr cycles around 0.8 to 1 million years ago is correctly reproduced.},

During the 46-million-year Ordovician Period (489--443 m.y.), a bewildering array of adaptive radiations of "Paleozoic- and Modern-type" biotas appeared in marine habitats, the first animals (arthropods) walked on land, and the first non-vascular bryophyte-like plants (based on their cryptospore record) colonized terrestrial areas with damp environments.

The major part is an assembly of genus- and species-level diversity data for the many Ordovician fossil groups. The book also presents an evaluation of how each group diversified through Ordovician time, with assessments of patterns of change and rates of origination and extinction.

abstract = {We present a new model of biogeochemical cycling over Phanerozoic time. This work couples a feedback-based model of atmospheric O2 and ocean nutrients (Lenton and Watson, 2000a, 2000b) with a geochemical carbon cycle model (Berner, 1991, 1994), a simple sulfur cycle, and additional components. The resulting COPSE model (Carbon-Oxygen-Phosphorus-Sulfur-Evolution) represents the co-evolution of biotic and abiotic components of the Earth system, in that it couples interactive and evolving terrestrial and marine biota to geochemical and tectonic processes. The model is forced with geological and evolutionary forcings and time-dependent solar insolation. The baseline model succeeds in giving simultaneous predictions of atmospheric O2, CO2, global temperature, ocean composition, $\delta$13C and $\delta$34S that are in reasonable agreement with available data and suggested constraints. The behavior of the coupled model is qualitatively different to single cycle models. While atmospheric pCO2 (CO2 partial pressure) predictions are mostly determined by the model forcings and the response of silicate weathering rate to pCO2 and temperature, multiple negative feedback processes and coupling of the C, O, P and S cycles are necessary for regulating pO2 while allowing $\delta$13C changes of sufficient amplitude to match the record. The results support a pO2 dependency of oxidative weathering of reduced carbon and sulfur, which raises early Paleozoic pO2 above the estimated requirement of Cambrian fauna and prevents unrealistically large $\delta$34S variation. They do not support a strong anoxia dependency of the C:P burial ratio of marine organic matter (Van Cappellen and Ingall, 1994, 1996) because this dependency raises early Paleozoic $\delta$13C and organic carbon burial rates too high. The dependency of terrestrial primary productivity on pO2 also contributes to oxygen regulation. An intermediate strength oxygen fire feedback on terrestrial biomass, which gives a pO2 upper limit of ∼1.6PAL (present atmospheric level) or 30 volume percent, provides the best combined pO2 and $\delta$13C predictions. Sulfur cycle coupling contributes critically to lowering the Permo-Carboniferous pCO2 and temperature minimum. The results support an inverse dependency of pyrite sulfur burial on pO2 (for example, Berner and Canfield, 1989 , which contributes to the shuttling of oxygen back and forth between carbonate carbon and gypsum sulfur. A pO2 dependency of photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation (Berner and others, 2000; Beerling and others, 2002) is important for producing sufficient magnitude of $\delta$13C variation. However, our results do not support an oxygen dependency of sulfur isotope fractionation in pyrite formation (Berner and others, 2000) because it generates unrealistically small variations in $\delta$34S. In the Early Paleozoic, COPSE predicts pO2=0.2-0.6PAL and pCO2>10PAL, with high oceanic [PO3-4] and low [SO=4]. Land plant evolution caused a 'phase change' in the Earth system by increasing weathering rates and shifting some organic burial to land. This change resulted in a major drop in pCO2 to 3 to 4PAL and a rise in pO2 to ∼1.5PAL in the Permo-Carboniferous, with temperatures below present, ocean variables nearer present concentrations, and PO4:NO3 regulated closer to Redfield ratio. A second O2 peak of similar or slightly greater magnitude appears in the mid-Cretaceous, before a descent towards PAL. Mesozoic CO2 is in the range 3 to 7PAL, descending toward PAL in the Cretaceous and Cenozoic.},

The role of the greenhouse gas CO2 in controlling global temperatures has therefore been questioned. Here we review the geologic records of CO2 and glaciations and find that CO2 was low (<500 ppm) during periods of long-lived and widespread continental glaciations and high (>1000 ppm) during other, warmer periods. The CO2 record is likely robust because independent proxy records are highly correlated with CO2 predictions from geochemical models. The Phanerozoic sea surface temperature record as inferred from shallow marine carbonate $\delta$18O values has been used to quantitatively test the importance of potential climate forcings, but it fails several first-order tests relative to more well-established paleoclimatic indicators: both the early Paleozoic and Mesozoic are calculated to have been too cold for too long. We explore the possible influence of seawater pH on the $\delta$18O record and find that a pH-corrected record matches the glacial record much better. Periodic fluctuations in the cosmic ray flux may be of some climatic significance, but are likely of second-order importance on a multimillion-year timescale.},

The influence of vascular land plants on weathering processes and global geochemical cycles is likely to have increased substantially during the Late Devonian owing to large increases in root biomass associated with development of: 1) arborescence (tree-sized stature), which increased root penetration depths, and 2) the seed habit, which allowed colonization of drier upland areas. It is hypothesized that rapidly increasing root mass led to transient intensification of the rate of soil formation and to permanent gains in the thickness and areal extent of deeply weathered soil profiles. -from Authors},

Believed to be an exception, the eastern Mediterranean Sea (containing the Herodotus and Levant basins) preserves the southern margin of the Neotethyan, or older, ocean. An exceptionally thick sedimentary cover and a lack of accurate magnetic anomaly data have led to contradicting views about its crustal nature and age. Here I analyse total and vector magnetic anomaly data from the Herodotus Basin. I identify a long sequence of lineated magnetic anomalies, which imply that the crust is oceanic. I use the shape, or skewness, of these magnetic anomalies to constrain the timing of crustal formation and find that it formed about 340 million years ago. I suggest that this oceanic crust formed either along the Tethys spreading system, implying the Neotethys Ocean came into being earlier than previously thought, or during the amalgamation of the Pangaea Supercontinent. Finally, the transition from the rather weak and stretched continental crust found in the Levant Basin to the relatively strong oceanic Herodotus crust seems to guide the present-day seismicity pattern as well as the plate kinematic evolution of the region.},

Using aggregated species occurrences in the Paleobiology Database, we generated a geographic network to quantify connectivity of Albian epicontinental basins and used the flow-based Infomap algorithm to delineate bioprovinces. Despite taxonomic, stratigraphic, and geographic limitations of the data, the Infomap bioprovinces are largely concordant with the traditional, qualitatively derived biogeographic model, including the Boreal-Pacific Subrealm, Arctic Subrealm, Tethyan Realm, and Austral Realm. An agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis applied to the same occurrence data failed to replicate the Infomap bioprovinces or reproduce the traditional qualitative model. The observed asymmetrical distribution of the Infomap bioprovinces is consistent with the known hemispheric differences in paleogeographic and oceanographic features of the Albian Earth. The geographic network derived from ammonoid data is twice as dense as the one derived for Albian benthic marine invertebrates and thus more effective in delineating global biogeographic units. The network-based approach establishes a reproducible quantitative framework for delineating geographic boundaries of marine bioprovinces, tracking biogeographic changes over evolutionary time scales, and identifying biotic and abiotic factors that influence global partitioning of marine biodiversity.},

abstract = {The end-Ordovician (Hirnantian) crisis is the first globally distinct extinction during the Phanerozoic, but its causes are still not fully known. Here, we present an integrated geochemical and petrographic analysis to understand the sedimentary conditions taking place before, during and after the Late Ordovician ice age. New data from the Zbrza (Holy Cross Mountains) and Go{\l}dap (Baltic Depression) boreholes shows that, like in other worldwide sections, the total organic carbon (TOC) content is elevated in the upper Katian and uppermost Hirnantian to Rhudannian black shales, but depleted (below 1%) during most of the Hirnantian. Euxinic conditions occurred in the photic zone in both TOC-rich intervals. This is based on the maleimide distribution, occurrence of aryl isoprenoids and isorenieratane, as well as a dominance of tiny pyrite framboids. Euxinic conditions were interrupted by the Hirnantian regression caused by glaciation. Sedimentation on the deep shelf changed to aerobic probably due to intense thermohaline circulation. Euxinia in the water column occurred directly during the time associated with the second pulse of the mass extinction with a termination of the end-Ordovician glaciation and sea level rise just at the Ordovician/Silurian (O/S) boundary. In contrast, we suggest based on inorganic proxies that bottom water conditions were generally oxic to dysoxic due to upwelling in the Rheic Ocean. The only episode of seafloor anoxia in the Zbrza basin was found at the O/S boundary, where all inorganic indicators showed elevated values typical for anoxia (U/Th > 1.25; V/Cr > 4.25; V/(V + Ni): 0.54–0.82 and Mo > 10–25 ppm). Significant differences in hopanes to steranes ratio and in C27–C29 sterane distribution between the Katian, Rhudannian and Hirnantian deposits indicate changes in marine microbial communities triggered by sharp climate change and Gondwana glaciation. The increase from biomarkers of cyanobacteria (2$\alpha$-methylhopanes) after the O/S boundary implied enhanced microbial activity following the mass extinction event.},

This will result in widespread impacts on biogeochemistry and ocean ecosystems 5–7 , particularly the health of aragonitic organisms, such as pteropods 7 , which can dominate polar surface water communities 6 . Here, we quantify the depth of the present-day Southern Ocean aragonite saturation horizon using hydrographic and ocean carbon chemistry observations, and use a large ensemble of simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) 8,9 to track its evolution. A new, shallow aragonite saturation horizon emerges in many Southern Ocean locations between now and the end of the century. While all ensemble members capture the emergence, internal climate variability may affect the year of emergence; thus, its detection may have been overlooked by ensemble average analysis in the past. The emergence of the new horizon is driven by the slow accumulation of anthropogenic CO 2 in the Southern Ocean thermocline, where the carbonate ion concentration exhibits a local minimum and approaches undersaturation. The new horizon is also apparent under an emission-stabilizing scenario indicating an inevitable, sudden decrease in the volume of suitable habitat for aragonitic organisms.},

abstract = {The lowermost Famennian deposits of the Kowala quarry (Holy Cross Mountains, Poland) are becoming famous for their rich fossil content such as their abundant phosphatized arthropod remains (mostly thylacocephalans). Here, for the first time, palaeontological and geochemical data were integrated to document abundance and diversity patterns in the context of palaeoenvironmental changes. During deposition, the generally oxic to suboxic conditions were interrupted at least twice by the onset of photic zone euxinia (PZE). Previously, PZE was considered as essential in preserving phosphatised fossils from, e.g., the famous Gogo Formation, Australia. Here, we show, however, that during PZE, the abundance of arthropods drastically dropped. The phosphorous content during PZE was also very low in comparison to that from oxic-suboxic intervals where arthropods are the most abundant. As phosphorous is essential for phosphatisation but also tends to flux off the sediment during bottom water anoxia, we propose that the PZE in such a case does not promote the fossilisation of the arthropods but instead leads to their impoverishment and non-preservation. Thus, the PZE conditions with anoxic bottom waters cannot be presumed as universal for exceptional fossil preservation by phosphatisation, and caution must be paid when interpreting the fossil abundance on the background of redox conditions.},

abstract = {Recent molecular clock data suggest with high probability a Cambrian origin of Embryophyta (also called land plants), indicating that their terrestrialization most probably started about 500 Ma. The fossil record of the ‘Cambrian Explosion' was limited to marine organisms and not visible in the plant fossil record. The most significant changes in early land plant evolution occurred during the Ordovician. For instance, the earliest bryophyte-like cryptospores and the oldest fragments of the earliest land plants are from the Middle and Late Ordovician, respectively. Organic geochemistry studies on biomarker compositions hint at a transition from green algae to land plants during the ‘Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event' (GOBE). The colonization of the terrestrial realms by land plants clearly had an impact on marine ecosystems. Interactions between the terrestrial and marine biospheres have been proposed and the radiation of land plants potentially impacted on CO2 and O2 concentrations and on global climate. In addition, the shift of strontium isotopes during the Ordovician is probably linked to changing terrestrial landscapes, affected by the first massive land invasion of eukaryotic terrestrial life. The land plants seem unaffected by the first global mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician that eliminated many marine invertebrate taxa.},

abstract = {Numerical models have been highly successful in simulating global carbon and nutrient cycles in today's ocean, together with observed spatial and temporal patterns of chlorophyll and plankton biomass at the surface. With this success has come some confidence in projecting the century‐scale response to continuing anthropogenic warming. There is also increasing interest in using such models to understand the role of plankton ecosystems in past oceans. However, today's marine environment is the product of billions of years of continual evolution—a process that continues today. In this paper, we address the questions of whether an assumption of species invariance is sufficient, and if not, under what circumstances current model projections might break down. To do this, we first identify the key timescales and questions asked of models. We then review how current marine ecosystem models work and what alternative approaches are available to account for evolution. We argue that for timescales of climate change overlapping with evolutionary timescales, accounting for evolution may to lead to very different projected outcomes regarding the timescales of ecosystem response and associated global biogeochemical cycling. This is particularly the case for past extinction events but may also be true in the future, depending on the eventual degree of anthropogenic disruption. The discipline of building new numerical models that incorporate evolution is also hugely beneficial in itself, as it forces us to question what we know about adaptive evolution, irrespective of its quantitative role in any specific event or environmental changes.},

Phytoplankton responses to a $\sim$&thinsp;350 kiloyear long phase of gradual late Maastrichtian (latest-Cretaceous) global warming starting at $\sim$&thinsp;66.4&thinsp;Ma can provide valuable insights into the long-term influences of global change on marine ecosystems. Here we perform micropaleontological analyses on three cores from the New Jersey paleoshelf, to assess the response of phytoplankton using cyst-forming dinoflagellates and benthic ecosystems using benthic foraminifera. Our records show that this Latest Maastrichtian Warming Event (LMWE), characterized by a 4.0&thinsp;±&thinsp;1.3&thinsp;⁰C warming of sea-surface waters on the New Jersey paleoshelf, resulted in a succession of nearly monospecific dinoflagellate cyst assemblages, dominated by the species Palynodinium grallator. This response, likely triggered by the combination of warmer and seasonally thermally-stratified seas, appears to have been more intense at offshore sites than at nearshore sites. The LMWE, and related dinoflagellate response, is associated with an impoverished benthic ecosystem. A wider geographic survey of literature data reveals that the dominance of P. grallator is a marker for the LMWE throughout the northern mid-latitudes. While the dinocyst assemblage returned to a stable, normal marine community in the last tens of thousands of years of the Maastrichtian, benthic foraminiferal diversity remained slightly suppressed. Increased ecosystem stress during the latest Maastrichtian potentially primed global ecosystems for the subsequent mass extinction following the K-Pg boundary Chicxulub impact.},

Free H 2 S may react with, and modify, the chemical structure of organic matter settling through the water column and in marine sediments, with hypothesized implications for carbon sequestration. Here, taking the example of Ocean Anoxic Event 2, we explore the potential impact of organic matter sulfurization on marine carbon and oxygen cycling by means of Earth system modeling. Our model experiments demonstrate that rapid sulfurization (k sulf ≥ = 10 5  M −1  year −1 ) of organic matter in the water column can drive a more than 30% enhancement of organic carbon preservation and burial in marine sediments and hence help accelerate climate cooling and Ocean Anoxic Event 2 recovery. As a consequence of organic matter sulfurization, we also find that H 2 S can be rapidly scavenged and the euxinic ocean volume reduced by up to 80%—helping reoxygenate the ocean as well as reducing toxic H 2 S emissions to the atmosphere, with potential implications for the kill mechanism at the end-Permian. Finally, we find that the addition of organic matter sulfurization induces a series of additional feedbacks, including further atmospheric CO 2 drawdown and ocean reoxygenation by the creation of a previously unrecognized net source of alkalinity to the ocean as H 2 S is scavenged and buried.},

abstract = {Because there remains a lack of knowledge about the spatially explicit distribution of chemical weathering rates at the global scale, a model that considers prominent first-order factors is compiled step by step and the implied spatial variability in weathering is explored. The goal is to fuel the discussion about the development of an "Earth System" weathering function. We use as a starting point an established model of the dependence of chemical weathering on lithology and runoff, calibrated for an island arc setting, which features very high chemical weathering rates and a strong dependence on lithology and runoff. The model is enhanced stepwise with further factors accounting for soil shielding and temperature, and the observed variation of fluxes is discussed in context of observed data from large rivers globally.Results suggest that the global soil shielding reduces chemical weathering (CW) fluxes by about 44%, compared to an Earth surface with no deeply weathered soils but relatively young rock surfaces (e.g. as in volcanic arc and other tectonically active areas). About 70% of the weathering fluxes globally derive from 10% of the land area, with Southeast Asia being a primary "hot spot" of chemical weathering. In contrast, only 50% of runoff is attributed to 10% of the land area; thus the global chemical weathering curve is to some extent disconnected from the global runoff curve due to the spatially heterogeneous climate as well as rock and soil properties. The analysis of carbonate dissolution reveals that about half of the flux is not delivered from labeled carbonate sedimentary rocks, but from trace carbonates in igneous rocks as well as from siliciclastic sediment areas containing matrix carbonate.In addition to total chemical weathering fluxes, the release of P, a nutrient that controls biological productivity at large spatial scales, is affected by the spatial correlation between runoff, lithology, temperature and soil properties. The areal abundance of deeply weathered soils in Earth's past may have influenced weathering fluxes and P-fuelled biological productivity significantly, specifically in the case of larger climate shifts when high runoff fields shift to areas with thinner soils or areas with more weatherable rocks and relatively increased P-content. This observation may be particularly important for spatially resolved Earth system models targeting geological time scales. The model is discussed against current process knowledge and geodata with focus on improving future global chemical weathering model attempts.Identified key processes and geodata demanding further research are a) the representation of flowpaths to distinguish surface runoff, interflow and baseflow contributions to CW-fluxes, b) freeze-thaw effects on chemical weathering, specifically for the northern latitudes, c) a more detailed analysis to identify to what extent the spatially heterogeneous distribution of Earth surface properties causes a decoupling of the Earth system rating functions between CW-fluxes and global runoff, as well as d) an improved understanding of where and to what extent trace or matrix carbonates in silicate-dominated rocks and sediments contribute to carbonate weathering. The latter demands e) an improved representation of carbonate content in lithological classes in the lithological representation of the Earth surface. Further improvement of the lithological database is needed for f) the age of rocks and g) the geochemistry of sediments with focus on unconsolidated sediments in the large basins. And clearly h) an improved global soil database is needed for future improvements with reliable soil depth, mineralogical composition as well as physical properties. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {A new coupled ocean atmosphere model was constructed for the purposes of studying the low frequency internal variability of the atmosphere ocean system. Extant models of the atmosphere and ocean designed for execution on massively parallel computing platforms were combined via a new component called the coupler to form the new model. This model is the first to have a closed hydrologic cycle via a river runoff model, a simple sea ice model, and a relatively high resolution ocean model all in one simulation. No flux corrections or other restraints on the model climate are employed. The model climate compares well with other coupled models as seen in means and trends presented here. A simulation of over 600 years was performed. An assessment of the model's low frequency variability was made with a rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis of sea surface temperature in three frequency bands. The first mode of variability in the highest frequency band of interest (less than five years) was related to the model ENSO. In the midband frequencies (five to thirty years), a decadal mode in the Tropical Pacific is most prominent followed by an Antarctic mode and decadal variability in the gyres of the North Pacific and Atlantic. The multidecadal (thirty years and longer) variability is mostly in the form of a thermohaline oscillation in the North Atlantic with a period of nearly fifty years. Other low frequency variability centers occur near locations of model deep water formation. Additional experiments were performed with the coupled model to determine which of several new atmosphere parameterizations is most responsible for an improvement in the simulated Tropical Pacific over earlier model versions. The addition of a parameterization for deep convection is found to be most responsible.},

The paleoDEMs are available in two formats: (1) a simple text file that lists the latitude, longitude and elevation of each grid point; and (2) as a netcdf file. The paleoDEMs have been used to produce: a set of paleogeographic maps for the Phanerozoic, a simulation of the Earth's past climate and paleoceanography, animations of the paleogeographic history of the world's oceans and continents, and an estimate of the changing area of land, mountains, shallow seas, and deep oceans through time.

abstract = {The Earth's cryosphere represents a huge climate-sensitive carbon reservoir capable of releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from permafrost soils or gas reservoirs capped by permafrost and ice caps upon rising global temperatures. Carbon release from these reservoirs has the potential to further accelerate global warming. Present day cryosphere demise is a focus of scientific research. The potential role of cryosphere carbon reservoirs in Mesozoic climate perturbations is even lesser known and currently underinvestigated. In contrast to previous views of a constantly warm Early Jurassic period, virtually lacking a cryosphere, recent studies have identified icehouse conditions for this time interval. Following these icehouse conditions, global warming occurred during the early Toarcian ($\sim$183 Ma) and was accompanied by a major carbon cycle anomaly as manifested in recurring negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs). We propose that an initially volcanic-driven gentle rise of atmospheric temperature in the Early Toarcian triggered a melt-down of Earth's cryosphere which during the preceding Pliensbachian had expanded to the mid-latitudes and thus was highly vulnerable to warming. The rapid release of greenhouse gases, mainly as 13C-depleted CH4, or its oxidation product CO2, is recorded in the carbon isotope ratios of sedimentary organic matter and carbonates. Toarcian sediments display a series of orbitally-forced negative CIEs characterized by a frequency shift from eccentricity to obliquity cycles comparable to Pleistocene climate rhythms. This pattern is explained by a self-sustaining destabilization of labile cryosphere carbon reservoirs which started at mid-latitudes where eccentricity is most effective and then rhythmically progressed poleward to latitudes where obliquity dominates. The hitherto underestimated presence of a temperature-sensitive Pliensbachian cryosphere constituted an essential precondition for the early Toarcian climate change and its associated sea-level rise. The Pliensbachian cooling had transferred water into the terrestrial cryosphere causing a severe sea-level fall. Transgressive pulses at the Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary and in the early Toarcian occurred concomitant to rising global temperatures and resulted from the meltdown of continental ice caps. This ice-volume effect and the massive discharge of freshwater into the oceans is well preserved in the exceptionally low $\delta$18O values of carbonates formed during the cryosphere demise and sea-level increase. Carbon and oxygen isotope ratios, climate and sea-level shifts thus underpin the presence of an Early Jurassic cryosphere and thereby highlight the role of glacio-eustatic mechanisms as main drivers of late Pliensbachian to early Toarcian geodynamics.},

abstract = {The geological record of the Paleozoic often exhibits cyclic features, in many cases the result of changes in paleoclimate. However, a thorough understanding of the processes that were driving Paleozoic climate change has not yet been reached. The main reason is relatively poor time-control on Paleozoic paleoclimate proxy records. This problem can be overcome by the identification of cyclic features resulting from astronomical climate forcing in the stratigraphic record. To correctly identify these cyclic features, it is necessary to quantify the effects of astronomical climate forcing under conditions different from today. In this work, we apply Late Devonian (375Ma) boundary conditions to the Hadley Centre general circulation model (HadSM3). We estimate the response of Late Devonian climate to astronomical forcing by keeping all other forcing factors (e.g. paleogeography, pCO2, vegetation distribution) fixed. Thirty-one different "snapshots" of Late Devonian climate are simulated, by running the model with different combinations of eccentricity (e), obliquity ($\epsilon$) and precession ($\omega$$\sim$). From the comparison of these 31 simulations, it appears that feedback mechanisms play an important role in the conversion of astronomically driven insolation variations into climate change, such as the formation of sea-ice and the development of an extensive snow cover on Gondwana. We compare the "median orbit" simulation to lithic indicators of paleoclimate to evaluate whether or not HadSM3 validly simulates Late Devonian climates. This comparison suggests that the model correctly locates the major climate zones. This study also tests the proposed link between the formation of ocean anoxia and high eccentricity (De Vleeschouwer et al., 2013) by comparing the $\delta$18Ocarb record of the Frasnian-Famennian boundary interval from the Kowala section (Poland) with a simulated time series of astronomically forced changes in mean annual temperature at the paleolocation of Poland. The amplitude of climate change suggested by the isotope record is greater than that of the simulated climate. Hence, astronomically forced climate change may have been further amplified by other feedback mechanisms not considered here (e.g. CO2 and vegetation). Finally, the geologic and simulated time series correlate best when the Frasnian-Famennian negative isotope excursion aligns with maximum mean annual temperature in Poland, which is obtained when eccentricity and obliquity are simultaneously high. This finding supports a connection between Devonian ocean anoxic events and astronomical climate forcing. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the aftermath of the catastrophic end-Permian mass extinction, the Early Triassic records recurrent perturbations in the carbon isotope signal, most notably during the Smithian and through the Smithian/Spathian Boundary (SSB; $\sim$ 1.5 myr after the Permian/Triassic boundary), which show some of the largest excursions of the Phanerozoic. The late Smithian also corresponds to major biotic turnovers and environmental changes, such as temperature fluctuations, that deeply impacted the recovery after the end-Permian mass extinction. Here we document the paired carbon isotope signal along with an analysis of the trace and major elements at the long-known Hot Springs section (southeastern Idaho, USA). This section records Early Triassic sediments from the Griesbachian-Dienerian up to the lower Spathian. We show that the organic and carbonate $\delta$ 13 C variations mirror the signals identified at a global scale. Particularly, the middle Smithian-SSB event represented by a negative-positive isotopic couplet is well identified and is not of diagenetic origin. We also document a positive excursion potentially corresponding to the Dienerian/Smithian Boundary. Observed Smithian-Spathian excursions are recorded similarly in both the organic and carbonate reservoirs, but the organic matter signal systematically shows unexpectedly dampened variations compared to its carbonate counterpart. Additionally, we show that variations in the net isotopic effect (i.e., $\Delta$ 13 C) probably resulted from a complex set of forcing parameters including either a mixing between terrestrial and marine organic matter depending on the evolution of the depositional setting, or variations in the biological fractionation. We establish that the $\Delta$ 13 C signal cannot be directly related to CO 2 -driven temperature variations at Hot Springs. Even though the carbon isotope signal mirrors the Early Triassic variations known at the global scale, the Hot Springs signal probably also reflects local influences on the carbon isotopes that are neither diagenetic nor representative of the global exogenic carbon cycle.},

abstract = {Both geological data and climate model studies indicate that substantially different patterns of the global ocean circulation have existed throughout the Cenozoic. In a climate model study of the late Oligocene [von der Heydt, A., Dijkstra, H.A. (2006). Effect of ocean gateways on the global ocean circulation in the late Oligocene and early Miocene. Paleoceanography, 21, PA1011] a "northern sinking" type of circulation was found, with (shallow) deep water formation in both the North Pacific Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. This is in contrast to the present-day "conveyor" circulation, where there is deep water formation in the North Atlantic but not in the North Pacific. In order to explain these differences, we use an ocean general circulation model for idealized two-basin flows and study the effect of asymmetries in the continental geometry on the circulation patterns. Two types of asymmetry are considered: (i) the relative northward extent of the Pacific and the Atlantic basin, and (ii) the existence of a circum-global gateway at low latitudes. The more northward extent of the Pacific basin in the Oligocene makes the Conveyor solution less likely and facilitates deep water formation in the North Pacific compared to the North Atlantic. The low-latitude gateway on the other hand, allows salinity and heat exchange between the two main ocean basins and therefore leads to deep water formation in both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent geologically-based reconstructions of the Eurasian ice sheet show that during the peak Saalian (≈ 140 kya) the ice sheet was larger over Eurasia than during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ≈ 21 kya. To address this problem we use the LMDZ4 atmospheric general circulation model to evaluate the impact on the Saalian ice sheet's surface mass balance (SMB) from proglacial lakes, dust deposition on snow, vegetation and sea surface temperatures (SST) since geological records suggest that these environmental parameters were different during the two glacial periods. Seven model simulations have been carried out. Dust deposition decreases the mean SMB by intensifying surface melt during summer while proglacial lakes cool the summer climate and reduce surface melt on the ice sheet. A simulation including both proglacial lakes and dust shows that the presence of the former parameter reduces the impact of the latter, in particular, during summer. A switch from needle-leaf to tundra vegetation affects the regional climate but not enough to significantly influence the SMB of the nearby ice margin. However, a steady-state vegetation in equilibrium with the climate should be computed to improve the boundary conditions for further evaluations of the vegetation impact on the ice sheet's SMB. Finally, changes of the SST broadly affect the regional climate with significant consequences for the SMB. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Sedimentological analysis reveals six facies associations, including interbedded black and grey shale couplets (poorly oxygenated shelf sediments), a bioturbated shale with wave rippled sandstone (inner shelf deposits), several occurrences of diamictite (of probable glaciogenic origin), interbedded sandstone and mudstone (storm and fair-weather wave agitated shoreface), rippled sandstone (storm return flow deposits) and amalgamated sandstone deposits (delta-front debris flows). Direct evidence for glaciation in the Hirnantian deposits is poor. Third order sequence stratigraphic analysis reveals two transgressive systems tracts (Late Katian and intra-Hirnantian), two highstand systems tracts (both intra-Hirnantian), lowstand wedges probably corresponding to two principal glacial lowstands, two maximum flooding surfaces (Late Katian and intra-Hirnantian), and a major ravinement surface (Hirnantian-Silurian contact). Remote from the centre of glaciation, the Tazzeka succession is suggested to be an excellent reference section with which to understand glacially-moderated sea-level changes in the Late Ordovician. Silurian (Late Llandovery or younger) shale geochemistry indicates organic enrichment (TOC > 4.5%). This organic enrichment greatly increases the known extent of the upper of two Silurian organic shales across North Africa (potential hydrocarbon source rocks) across the region. {\textcopyright} 2008 Inertnational Association for Gondwana Research.},

abstract = {Plant traits - the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants and their organs - determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69000 out of the world's 300000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation - but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Mass wasting at continental margins on a global scale during the Middle Ordovician has recently been related to high meteorite influx. Although a high meteorite influx during the Ordovician should not be neglected, we challenge the idea that mass wasting was mainly produced by meteorite impacts over a period of almost 10. Ma. Having strong arguments against the impact-related hypothesis, we propose an alternative explanation, which is based on a re-evaluation of the mass wasting sites, considering their plate-tectonic distribution and the global sea level curve. A striking and important feature is the distribution of most of the mass wasting sites along continental margins characterised by periods of magmatism, terrane accretion and continental or back-arc rifting, respectively, related to subduction of oceanic lithosphere. Such processes are commonly connected with seismic activity causing earthquakes, which can cause downslope movement of sediment and rock. Considering all that, it seems more likely that most of this mass wasting was triggered by earthquakes related to plate-tectonic processes, which caused destabilisation of continental margins resulting in megabreccias and debris flows. Moreover, the period of mass wasting coincides with sea level drops during global sea level lowstand. In some cases, sea level drops can release pore-water overpressure reducing sediment strength and hence promoting instability of sediment at continental margins. Reduced pore-water overpressure can also destabilise gas hydrate-bearing sediment, causing slope failure, and thus resulting in submarine mass wasting. Overall, the global mass wasting during the Middle Ordovician does not need meteoritic trigger. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

abstract = {With representation of the global carbon cycle becoming increasingly complex in climate models, it is important to develop ways to quantitatively evaluate model performance against in situ and remote sensing observations. Here we present a systematic framework, the Carbon-LAnd Model Intercomparison Project (C-LAMP), for assessing terrestrial biogeochemistry models coupled to climate models using observations that span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. As an example of the value of such comparisons, we used this framework to evaluate two biogeochemistry models that are integrated within the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) -Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach′ (CASA′) and carbon-nitrogen (CN). Both models underestimated the magnitude of net carbon uptake during the growing season in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems, based on comparison with atmospheric CO 2 measurements and eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange. Comparison with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements show that this low bias in model fluxes was caused, at least in part, by 1-3 month delays in the timing of maximum leaf area. In the tropics, the models overestimated carbon storage in woody biomass based on comparison with datasets from the Amazon. Reducing this model bias will probably weaken the sensitivity of terrestrial carbon fluxes to both atmospheric CO2 and climate. Global carbon sinks during the 1990s differed by a factor of two (2.4PgCyr-1 for CASA′ vs. 1.2PgCyr-1 for CN), with fluxes from both models compatible with the atmospheric budget given uncertainties in other terms. The models captured some of the timing of interannual global terrestrial carbon exchange during 1988-2004 based on comparison with atmospheric inversion results from TRANSCOM (r =0.66 for CASA′ and r =0.73 for CN). Adding (CASA′) or improving (CN) the representation of deforestation fires may further increase agreement with the atmospheric record. Information from C-LAMP has enhanced model performance within CCSM and serves as a benchmark for future development. We propose that an open source, community-wide platform for model-data intercomparison is needed to speed model development and to strengthen ties between modeling and measurement communities. Important next steps include the design and analysis of land use change simulations (in both uncoupled and coupled modes), and the entrainment of additional ecological and earth system observations. Model results from C-LAMP are publicly available on the Earth System Grid. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {This study tests the ability of five Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), forced with observed climatology and atmospheric CO2, to model the contemporary global carbon cycle. The DGVMs are also coupled to a fast 'climate analogue model', based on the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model (GCM), and run into the future for four Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES): A1FI, A2, B1, B2. Results show that all DGVMs are consistent with the contemporary global land carbon budget. Under the more extreme projections of future environmental change, the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. In particular, large uncertainties are associated with the response of tropical vegetation to drought and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. The DGVMs show more divergence in their response to regional changes in climate than to increases in atmospheric CO2 content. All models simulate a release of land carbon in response to climate, when physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant production are not considered, implying a positive terrestrial climate-carbon cycle feedback. All DGVMs simulate a reduction in global net primary production (NPP) and a decrease in soil residence time in the tropics and extra-tropics in response to future climate. When both counteracting effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem function are considered, all the DGVMs simulate cumulative net land carbon uptake over the 21st century for the four SRES emission scenarios. However, for the most extreme A1FI emissions scenario, three out of five DGVMs simulate an annual net source of CO2 from the land to the atmosphere in the final decades of the 21st century. For this scenario, cumulative land uptake differs by 494PgC among DGVMs over the 21st century. This uncertainty is equivalent to over 50 years of anthropogenic emissions at current levels. {\textcopyright} Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {It is now recognized that the late Telychian and early Gorstian sea level changes are, like many others in the Silurian, of worldwide extent. The 30-50 m deepening events at these times were between i and 2 Ma in duration, so melting continental ice caps appear to be the most probable cause. The faunal changes associated with the two events are respectively very close to the base and the top of the Wenlock Series and thus segregate many of the faunas diagnostic of the Llandovery, Wenlock, and Ludlow series. Permanent extinctions (often followed by radiations) are more prevalent in the graptolites, conodonts, and acritarchs, while benthic faunas are more affected by regional shifts in community distributions. This means that, in the benthos, slowly evolving lineages are the only reliable guides to time. Such phyletic evolution, however, appears to have been unaffected by sea-level events. {\textcopyright} 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

New approaches use diatoms to reconstruct sea ice through the late Quaternary from core sites in the Southern Ocean. The sea-ice records provide evidence of increased sea ice at the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 yr ago) and changing sea-ice cover through the past 190 k.y.

This subducted lithosphere lies concentrated in areas of cold mantle that correspond to gross mantle heterogeneities delineated by seismic tomography and the geoid and inversely related to the global distribution of hotspots. Differences in graveyard distribution result from displacements of trenches (assumed nearly fixed to the overriding plates) over the mantle. Net convergence at selected subduction zones also shows variability: in the past 150 m.y. Previous workers have shown that a decrease in global spreading rates (based on estimating the geometry and spreading history of ridges for the past 80 m.y.) is the primary cause of a volume decrease in mid-ocean ridges and is consisent with a corresponding lowering of eustatic sea level during this time interval. We present an extension of this hypothesis to the past 180 m.y. by using our rates of global lithospheric consumption to estimate total global spreading and calculate the inferred changes in mid-ocean ridge volumes. -from Authors},

abstract = {Glaciation during the late Palaeozoic era (340-250 Myr ago) is thought to have been episodic, with multiple, often regional, ice-age intervals, each lasting less than 10 million years. Sedimentary deposits from these ice-age intervals exhibit cyclical depositional patterns, which have been attributed to orbitally driven glacial-interglacial cycles and resultant fluctuations in global sea level. Here we use a coupled general-circulation/biome/ice-sheet model to assess the conditions necessary for glacial-interglacial fluctuations. In our simulations, ice sheets appear at atmospheric pCO 2 concentrations between 420 and 840 ppmv. However, we are able to simulate ice-sheet fluctuations consistent with eustasy estimates and the distribution of glacial deposits only when we include vegetation feedbacks from high-latitude ecosystem changes. We find that ice-sheet advances follow the expansion of high-latitude tundra during insolation minima, whereas ice retreat is associated with the expansion of barren land close to the edge of the ice sheets during periods of high insolation. We are unable to simulate glacial-interglacial cycles in the absence of a dynamic vegetation component. We therefore suggest that vegetation feedbacks driven by orbital insolation variations are a crucial element of glacial-interglacial cyclicity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), where the number of species increases from the poles to the Equator, ranks among the broadest and most notable biodiversity patterns on Earth. The pattern of species-rich tropics relative to species-poor temperate areas has been recognized for well over a century, but the generative mechanisms are still debated vigorously. We use simulations to test whether spatio-temporal climatic changes could generate large-scale patterns of biodiversity as a function of only three biological processes—speciation, extinction and dispersal—omitting adaptive niche evolution, diversity-dependence and coexistence limits. In our simulations, speciation resulted from range disjunctions, whereas extinction occurred when no suitable sites were accessible to species. Simulations generated clear LDGs that closely match empirical LDGs for three major vertebrate groups. Higher tropical diversity primarily resulted from higher low-latitude speciation, driven by spatio-temporal variation in precipitation rather than in temperature. This suggests that spatio-temporal changes in low-latitude precipitation prompted geographical range disjunctions over Earth's history, leading to high rates of allopatric speciation that contributed to LDGs. Overall, we show that major global biodiversity patterns can derive from interactions of species' niches (fixed a priori in our simulations) with dynamic climate across complex, existing landscapes, without invoking biotic interactions or niche-related adaptations. The number of species increases from the poles to the Equator; yet it is unclear what determines this pattern. Using simulations, the authors show that spatio-temporal climatic changes recapitulate the patterns of vertebrate biodiversity as a function of speciation, extinction and dispersal alone.},

abstract = {Many studies have implied significant effects of global climate change on marine life. Setting these alterations into the context of historical natural change has not been attempted so far, however. Here, using a theoretical framework, we estimate the sensitivity of marine pelagic biodiversity to temperature change and evaluate its past (mid-Pliocene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)), contemporaneous (1960-2013) and future (2081-2100; 4 scenarios of warming) vulnerability. Our biodiversity reconstructions were highly correlated to real data for several pelagic taxa for the contemporary and the past (LGM and mid-Pliocene) periods. Our results indicate that local species loss will be a prominent phenomenon of climate warming in permanently stratified regions, and that local species invasion will prevail in temperate and polar biomes under all climate change scenarios. Although a small amount of warming under the RCP2.6 scenario is expected to have a minor influence on marine pelagic biodiversity, moderate warming (RCP4.5) will increase by threefold the changes already observed over the past 50 years. Of most concern is that severe warming (RCP6.0 and 8.5) will affect marine pelagic biodiversity to a greater extent than temperature changes that took place between either the LGM or the mid-Pliocene and today, over an area of between 50 (RCP6.0: 46.9-52.4%) and 70% (RCP8.5: 69.4-73.4%) of the global ocean.},

abstract = {According to future anthropogenic emission scenarios, the atmospheric CO 2 concentration may double before the end of the twenty-first century. This increase is predicted to result in a global warming of more than 6°C in the worst case. The global temperature increase will promote changes in the hydrologic cycle through redistributions of rainfall patterns and continental vegetation cover. All of these changes will impact the chemical weathering of continental rocks. Long considered an inert CO 2 consumption flux at the century timescale, recent works have demonstrated its potential high sensitivity to the ongoing climate and land-use changes. Here we show that the CO 2 consumption flux related to weathering processes increases by more than 50% for an atmospheric CO 2 doubling for one of the most important Arctic watersheds: the Mackenzie River Basin. This result has been obtained using a process-based model of the chemical weathering of continental surfaces forced by models describing the atmospheric general circulation and the dynamic of the vegetation under increased atmospheric CO 2 . Our study stresses the potential role that weathering may play in the evolution of the global carbon cycle over the next centuries. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {It is widely believed that the Sahara desert is no more than ∼2-3 million years (Myr) old<sup>1</sup>, with geological evidence showing a remarkable aridification of north Africa at the onset of the Quaternary ice ages<sup>2-4</sup>. Before that time, north African aridity was mainly controlled by the African summer monsoon (ASM)<sup>5-8</sup>, which oscillated with Earth's orbital precession cycles. Afterwards, the Northern Hemisphere glaciation added an ice volume forcing on the ASM, which additionally oscillated with glacial-interglacial cycles<sup>2</sup>. These findings led to the idea that the Sahara desert came into existence when the Northern Hemisphere glaciated ∼2-3 Myr ago. The later discovery, however, of aeolian dune deposits ∼7 Myr old<sup>9</sup> suggested a much older age, although this interpretation is hotly challenged<sup>1</sup> and there is no clear mechanism for aridification around this time. Here we use climate model simulations to identify the Tortonian stage (∼7-11 Myr ago) of the Late Miocene epoch as the pivotal period for triggering north African aridity and creating the Sahara desert. Through a set of experiments with the Norwegian Earth System Model<sup>10</sup> and the Community Atmosphere Model<sup>11</sup>, we demonstrate that the African summer monsoon was drastically weakened by the Tethys Sea shrinkage during the Tortonian, allowing arid, desert conditions to expand across north Africa. Not only did the Tethys shrinkage alter the mean climate of the region, it also enhanced the sensitivity of the African monsoon to orbital forcing, which subsequently became the major driver of Sahara extent fluctuations. These important climatic changes probably caused the shifts in Asian and African flora and fauna observed during the same period<sup>4,12-14</sup>, with possible links to the emergence of early hominins in north Africa<sup>15,16</sup>.},

abstract = {On timescales significantly greater than 10 5 years, atmospheric p CO 2 is controlled by the rate of mantle outgassing relative to the set-point of the silicate weathering feedback. The weathering set-point has been shown to depend on the distribution and characteristics of rocks exposed at the Earth's surface, vegetation types and topography. Here we argue that large-scale climate impacts caused by changes in ocean circulation can also modify the weathering set-point and show evidence suggesting that this played a role in the establishment of the Antarctic ice sheet at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. In our simulations, tectonic deepening of the Drake Passage causes freshening and stratification of the Southern Ocean, strengthening the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and consequently raising temperatures and intensifying rainfall over land. These simulated changes are consistent with late Eocene tectonic reconstructions that show Drake Passage deepening, and with sediment records that reveal Southern Ocean stratification, the emergence of North Atlantic Deep Water, and a hemispherically asymmetric temperature change. These factors would have driven intensified silicate weathering and can thereby explain the drawdown of carbon dioxide that has been linked with Antarctic ice sheet growth. We suggest that this mechanism illustrates another way in which ocean-Atmosphere climate dynamics can introduce nonlinear threshold behaviour through interaction with the geologic carbon cycle.},

Yet the secular evolution of the planetary orbits beyond 50 million years ago remains highly uncertain, and the chaotic dynamical nature of the Solar System predicted by theoretical models has yet to be rigorously confirmed by well constrained (radioisotopically calibrated and anchored) geological data. Here we present geological evidence for a chaotic resonance transition associated with interactions between the orbits of Mars and the Earth, using an integrated radioisotopic and astronomical timescale from the Cretaceous Western Interior Basin of what is now North America. This analysis confirms the predicted chaotic dynamical behaviour of the Solar System, and provides a constraint for refining numerical solutions for insolation, which will enable a more precise and accurate geological timescale to be produced.},

abstract = {The onset of the late Palaeozoic ice age about 340 million years ago has been attributed to a decrease in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations associated with expansion of land plants, as plants both enhance silicate rock weathering - which consumes CO 2 - and increase the storage of organic carbon on land. However, plant expansion and carbon uptake substantially predate glaciation. Here we use climate and carbon cycle simulations to investigate the potential effects of the uplift of the equatorial Hercynian mountains and the assembly of Pangaea on the late Palaeozoic carbon cycle. In our simulations, mountain uplift during the Late Carboniferous caused an increase in physical weathering that removed the thick soil cover that had inhibited silicate weathering. The resulting increase in chemical weathering was sufficient to cause atmospheric CO 2 concentrations to fall below the levels required to initiate glaciation. During the Permian, the lowering of the mountains led to a re-establishment of thick soils, whilst the assembly of Pangaea promoted arid conditions in continental interiors that were unfavourable for silicate weathering. These changes allowed CO 2 concentrations to rise to levels sufficient to terminate the glacial event. Based on our simulations, we suggest that tectonically influenced carbon cycle changes during the late Palaeozoic were sufficient to initiate and terminate the late Palaeozoic ice age.},

abstract = {The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is a key influence on Earth's climate. Today, significant quantities of CO2 are emitted at continental rifts, suggesting that the spatial and temporal extent of rift systems may have influenced deep carbon fluxes and thus climate change throughout geological time. Here we test this hypothesis by conducting a worldwide census of continental rift lengths over the last 200 million years. We estimate tectonic CO2 release rates through time and show that along the extensive Mesozoic and Cenozoic rift systems, rift-related CO2 degassing rates reached more than 300% of present-day values. Using a numerical carbon cycle model, we find that two prominent periods of enhanced rifting 160 to 100 million years ago and after 55 million years ago coincided with greenhouse climate episodes, during which atmospheric CO2 concentrations were more than three times higher than today. We therefore propose that continental fragmentation and long-term climate change could plausibly be linked via massive CO2 degassing in rift systems.},

abstract = {Recovery from the end-Permian mass extinction is frequently described as delayed, with complex ecological communities typically not found in the fossil record until the Middle Triassic epoch. However, the taxonomic diversity of a number of marine groups, ranging from ammonoids to benthic foraminifera, peaked rapidly in the Early Triassic. These variations in biodiversity occur amidst pronounced excursions in the carbon isotope record, which are compatible with episodes of massive CO 2 outgassing from the Siberian Large Igneous Province. Here we present a high-resolution Early Triassic temperature record based on the oxygen isotope composition of pristine apatite from fossil conodonts. Our reconstruction shows that the beginning of the Smithian substage of the Early Triassic was marked by a cooler climate, followed by an interval of warmth lasting until the Spathian substage boundary. Cooler conditions resumed in the Spathian. We find the greatest increases in taxonomic diversity during the cooler phases of the early Smithian and early Spathian. In contrast, a period of extreme warmth in the middle and late Smithian was associated with floral ecological change and high faunal taxonomic turnover in the ocean. We suggest that climate upheaval and carbon-cycle perturbations due to volcanic outgassing were important drivers of Early Triassic biotic recovery. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Totten Glacier, the primary outlet of the Aurora Subglacial Basin, has the largest thinning rate in East Antarctica. Thinning may be driven by enhanced basal melting due to ocean processes, modulated by polynya activity. Warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water, which has been linked to glacier retreat in West Antarctica, has been observed in summer and winter on the nearby continental shelf beneath 400 to 500 m of cool Antarctic Surface Water. Here we derive the bathymetry of the sea floor in the region from gravity and magnetics data as well as ice-thickness measurements. We identify entrances to the ice-shelf cavity below depths of 400 to 500 m that could allow intrusions of warm water if the vertical structure of inflow is similar to nearby observations. Radar sounding reveals a previously unknown inland trough that connects the main ice-shelf cavity to the ocean. If thinning trends continue, a larger water body over the trough could potentially allow more warm water into the cavity, which may, eventually, lead to destabilization of the low-lying region between Totten Glacier and the similarly deep glacier flowing into the Reynolds Trough. We estimate that at least 3.5 m of eustatic sea level potential drains through Totten Glacier, so coastal processes in this area could have global consequences.},

abstract = {Most of the marine biotic crises that occurred during the hot Mesozoic era have been linked to episodes of extreme warmth. Others, however, may have occurred during cooler intervals that interrupted Cretaceous greenhouse warmth. There are some indications of cooling in the late Aptian (116-114 Myr ago), but it has not been definitively linked to biotic crisis. Here we assess the timing and magnitude of late Aptian cooling and its association with biotic crises using a suite of geochemical and micropalaeontological assessments from a marine sediment core from the North Atlantic Ocean as well as global biogeochemical modelling. Sea surface temperatures derived from the TEX 86 proxy suggest that surface waters cooled by about 5C during the two million years, coincident with a positive $\delta$ 13 C excursion of approximately 2‰ in carbonates and organic carbon. Surface productivity was enhanced during this period, but the abundance of planktonic foraminifera and nannoconid phytoplankton declined. Our simulations with a biogeochemical model indicate that the $\delta$ 13 C excursion associated with the cooling could be explained by the burial of about 812,000 gigatons of carbon over 2.5 million years. About 50% of the this carbon burial occurred in the Atlantic, Southern and Tethys ocean basins. We conclude that global cooling during greenhouse conditions can cause perturbations to marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles at scales comparable to those associated with global warming. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The beginning of the current interglacial period, the Holocene epoch, was a critical part of the transition from glacial to interglacial climate conditions. This period, between about 12,000 and 7,000 years ago, was marked by the continued retreat of the ice sheets that had expanded through polar and temperate regions during the preceding glacial. This meltdown led to a dramatic rise in sea level, punctuated by short-lived jumps associated with catastrophic ice-sheet collapses. Tracking down which ice sheet produced specific sea-level jumps has been challenging, but two events between 8,500 and 8,200 years ago have been linked to the final drainage of glacial Lake Agassiz in north-central North America. The release of the water from this ice-dammed lake into the ocean is recorded by sea-level jumps in the Mississippi and Rhine-Meuse deltas of approximately 0.4 and 2.1 metres, respectively. These sea-level jumps can be related to an abrupt cooling in the Northern Hemisphere known as the 8.2 kyr event, and it has been suggested that the freshwater release from Lake Agassiz into the North Atlantic was sufficient to perturb the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. As sea-level rise on the order of decimetres to metres can now be detected with confidence and linked to climate records, it is becoming apparent that abrupt climate change during the early Holocene associated with perturbations in North Atlantic circulation required sustained freshwater release into the ocean. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Results include seasonal, interannual, and short-Term (daily) variations. In most regions, estimated seasonality is well constrained from the data, and compares well to the widely used monthly climatology by Takahashi et al. (2009). Comparison to independent data tentatively supports the slightly higher seasonal variations in our estimates in some areas. We also fitted the diagnostic model to atmospheric CO2 data. The results of this are less robust, but in those areas where atmospheric signals are not strongly influenced by land flux variability, their seasonality is nevertheless consistent with the results based on surface-ocean data. From a comparison with an independent seasonal climatology of surface-ocean nutrient concentration, the diagnostic model is shown to capture relevant surface-ocean biogeochemical processes reasonably well.

In particular, the adoption of "z*" avoids the difficult issue of vanishing levels under thick ice. Details of the implementation within MITgcm are provided. A high resolution global ocean sea ice simulation illustrates the robustness of the z* formulation and reveals a source of oceanic variability associated with sea ice dynamics and ice-loading effects.

Their affinities are contentious, but knowledge of their relationships is essential to understanding the nature of the earliest land flora. This review brings together evidence about the source plants, mostly obtained from spores extracted from minute, fragmented, yet exceptionally anatomically preserved fossils. We coin the term 'cryptophytes' for plants that produced the cryptospores and show them to have been simple terrestrial organisms of short stature (i.e. millimetres high). Two lineages are currently recognized. Partitatheca shows a combination of characters (e.g. spo-rophyte bifurcation, stomata, and dyads) unknown in plants today. Lenticulatheca encompasses discoidal sporangia containing monads formed from dyads with ultrastructure closer to that of higher plants, as exemplified by Cooksonia. Other emerging groupings are less well characterized, and their precise affinities to living clades remain unclear. Some may be stem group embryophytes or tracheophytes. Others are more closely related to the bryophytes, but they are not bryophytes as defined by extant representatives. Cryptophytes encompass a pool of diversity from which modern bryophytes and vascular plants emerged, but were competitively replaced by early tracheophytes. Sporogenesis always produced either dyads or tetrads, indicating strict genetic control. The long-held consensus that tetrads were the archetypal condition in land plants is challenged. {\textcopyright} 2014 New Phytologist Trust.},

The mechanism or change in the carbon cycle that promoted this glaciation, thereby resulting in the extinction, is still debated. Here we report new, coupled nitrogen isotope analyses of bulk sediments and chlorophyll degradation products (porphyrins) from the Vinini Creek section (Vinini Formation, Nevada, USA) to show that eukaryotes increasingly dominated marine export production in the lead-up to the Hirnantian extinction. We then use these findings to evaluate changes in the carbon cycle by incorporating them into a biogeochemical model in which production is increased in response to an elevated phosphorus inventory, potentially caused by enhanced continental weathering in response to the activity of land plants and/or an episode of volcanism. The results suggest that expanded eukaryotic algal production may have increased the community average cell size, leading to higher export efficiency during the Late Katian. The coincidence of this community shift with a large-scale marine transgression increased organic carbon burial, drawing down CO2 and triggering the Hirnantian glaciation. This episode may mark an early Palaeozoic strengthening of the biological pump, which, for a short while, may have made eukaryotic algae indirect killers.},

abstract = {•The advent of embryophytes (land plants) is among the most important evolutionary breakthroughs in Earth history. It irreversibly changed climates and biogeochemical processes on a global scale; it allowed all eukaryotic terrestrial life to evolve and to invade nearly all continental environments. Before this work, the earliest unequivocal embryophyte traces were late Darriwilian (late Middle Ordovician; c. 463-461 million yr ago (Ma)) cryptospores from Saudi Arabia and from the Czech Republic (western Gondwana). •Here, we processed Dapingian (early Middle Ordovician, c. 473-471 Ma) palynological samples from Argentina (eastern Gondwana). •We discovered a diverse cryptospore assemblage, including naked and envelope-enclosed monads and tetrads, representing five genera. •Our discovery reinforces the earlier suggestion that embryophytes first evolved in Gondwana. It indicates that the terrestrialization of plants might have begun in the eastern part of Gondwana. The diversity of the Dapingian assemblage implies an earlier, Early Ordovician or even Cambrian, origin of embryophytes. Dapingian to Aeronian (Early Silurian) cryptospore assemblages are similar, suggesting that the rate of embryophyte evolution was extremely slow during the first c. 35-45 million yr of their diversification. The Argentinean cryptospores predate other cryptospore occurrences by c. 8-12 million yr, and are currently the earliest evidence of plants on land. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2010).

abstract = {The growth and destruction of continental ice-sheets in North Africa and adjacent parts of Gondwana during the Hirnantian Stage had profound influence on the sedimentary style of mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sequences on Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada. These strata, deposited in a tropical, mid-shelf setting, show direct evidence of local sea-level changes of up to 40 m. After correction for tectonic and load-induced subsidence this indicates maximum global glacio-eustatic changes of 32 to 36 m. This implies maximum ice volume of about 12 to 14 × 106 km3 and related changes in the oxygen isotopic composition of global sea water amounting to as little as 0.5 to 0.6%. Given that the oxygen isotope ratios in syn-glacial samples from the Anticosti sequence range from -8.9 to -2.8 $\delta$18O, it is not possible to clearly distinguish the effects of ice-cap development from temperature and diagenetic controlled variation. The strong negative shift in $\delta$13C values at the top of the Ellis Bay Formation may indicate a pronounced increase in atmospheric CO2 coincident with destruction of the Late Ordovician ice-caps. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Data on 493 Phanerozoic marine ooid and cement occurrences indicate that the dominance of calcite versus aragonite in tropical marine settings has changed in response to variation in atmospheric CO 2 and/or oceanic temperature gradient. Holocene ooid and cement precipitation occurs over similar latitudes, with means centered around 24° and 28°, respectively. Aragonite and calcite also display roughly comparable distributions, with average occurrences between 25° and 28°. Surface seawater saturation values requisite for ooid-cement carbonate precipitation are at least 3.8 ($\Omega$ arg ) for aragonite and 3.4 ($\Omega$ arg ) for calcite. Ancient ooid-cement occurrences vary in space and time, with depositional zones generally closer to the equator during continental emergence; greatest extent correlates with periods of maximum transgression. Aragonite formation is favored in more equatorial localities than calcite when cement-ooid distributions are narrow and continents are emergent. Similarity of latitude distribution of marine ooids, cement, and biogenic carbonate suggests that physicochemical processes that control levels of carbonate saturation were more important in predicating sites of limestone accumulation in Phanerozoic seas than biological processes related to net productivity of various carbonate platform communities. Continental position and tropical shelf area available for carbonate accumulation dictates the relative abundance of shallow water inorganic carbonate precipitates in space and time. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {The opening of the Brazilian Paleozoic basins during the Late Ordovician was followed by a tectonic stabilization in the Silurian. At the time of the Early Silurian glaciations, deposition of continental sandstones prevailed in the basins. Offshore environments were present in the Amazonas Basin and, to a smaller extent, in the Paran{\'{a}} Basin. The ice sheets advanced over fluviatile and littoral sediments, except for the south margin of the Amazonas Basin, where the glacial diamictites immediately overlie marine facies. The ice produced much meltwater, even when advancing, and this was probably climatically controlled. The ice movements were from the northwest at the northern margin of the Amazonas Basin, and towards the northeast at the southern margin. In the Parna{\'{i}}ba Basin and its outliers, the Jatob{\'{a}} Basin and Cariri Valley, the ice came from southeast, and probably also from east. Further to the south, in the Paran{\'{a}} Basin, it came from the north and northeast. Four glaciations have been dated to the Early Silurian. The oldest is dated as latest Ashgill and/or earliest Llandovery in the Paran{\'{a}} Basin, as evidenced from tillites in the upper Rio Iva{\'{i}} and lower Vila Maria Formations (including the former Iap{\'{o}} Formation). It is contemporaneous with a glaciation in the Cape Basin, South Africa. The next glaciation is dated as early middle Llandovery (gregarius graptolite Zone) and is present in the Amazonas Basin and the Andean Belt, and probably also in the Parna{\'{i}}ba Basin and its outliers. The two youngest tillites were widespread in the northern Brazilian basins (Amazonas, Parna{\'{i}}ba and Jatob{\'{a}} basins and Cariri Valley), as well as in the Andean Belt, and are dated as early late Llandovery (possibly starting already in the late middle Llandovery) and latest Llandovery to earliest Wenlock. The latter tillite is the most widespread one. Assuming these glaciations are related to polar positions, the apparent migration of the South Pole ice cap must have been quite rapid, from central North Africa in late Ashgill towards central Brazil in the middle-late Llandovery. The glaciation in the Paran{\'{a}} Basin took place up to 45° from the late Ashgillian South Pole. The cool climate continued during the Silurian, but no new glaciations are known before latest Devonian. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Ophiomorpha, traditionally one of the most revered environmental indicators among trace fossils, is by no means an unambiguous entity in facies analysis and palaeoecology. Callianassa major, the best known modern analog for the Ophiomorpha-organism, is itself variable ethologically and ecologically, and it is only one of several species of thalassinidean shrimp that routinely construct knobby walled burrows. Other analogs presently known include not only additional species of Callianassa but also certain species of Upogebia and possibly Axius. Each species has its own peculiar range of habits and habitats. The collective result, in both recent and ancient settings, is a broad spectrum of burrow morphologies and environmental distributions. Each occurrence therefore must be evaluated independently, in terms of the specific evidence at hand. Only in this light is Ophiomorpha a valuable aid in environmental interpretation. The gross morphology of Ophiomorpha overlaps with that of such ichnogenera as Ardelia, Gyrolithes, Teichichnus, and Thalassinoides, yet these burrow forms should be retained as separate taxa. Reconized species of Ophiomorpha, also somewhat intergradational, include O. borneensis Keij, O. irregulaire n. sp., and O. nodosa Lundgren. Taxonomic criteria are based upon modes of wall construction rather than upon burrow configuration. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {We performed sensitivity experiments with the global climate model GENESIS on two stages of the Upper Ordovician (Caradocian, ∼454 Ma; Ashgillian, ∼446 Ma) under a range of atmospheric pCO2 values (8-18× PAL; Pre-industrial Atmospheric Level), high and low sea level, and two values of poleward ocean heat transport in order to determine the importance of these variables on global cooling. We then coupled a three-dimensional ice sheet model to the global climate model in order to investigate the necessary boundary conditions for ice sheet formation. All simulations with a high sea level and normal heat transport remain free of ice sheets, even with pCO 2 levels as low as 8× PAL. In the Caradocian simulations, ice sheets form in three scenarios: (1) with pCO2 of 8× PAL and a low sea level and normal poleward ocean heat transport, (2) with pCO 2 of 8× PAL and a high sea level and reduced (50% of normal) poleward ocean heat transport, and (3) with pCO2 of 15× PAL and a low sea level and reduced poleward ocean heat transport. In the Ashgillian simulations, ice sheets form in only two scenarios: (1) with pCO 2 of 8× PAL and a low sea level and normal poleward ocean heat transport, or (2) with pCO2 of 8× PAL and a high sea level and reduced poleward ocean heat transport. The ice sheets in the Ashgillian experiments are larger and thicker than the ice sheets in the Caradocian simulations because the southward movement of Gondwana increased land area in the higher southern latitudes where ice sheets could grow. The threshold for glaciation under Ashgillian paleogeography is 8× PAL and either a low sea level (exposed shelves) or a reduced poleward ocean heat transport. While the paleogeographic evolution and a drop in pCO2 during the Late Ordovician cooled the global climate, changes in additional factors were required to initiate ice sheet formation, such as a drop in sea level, a reduction in poleward ocean heat transport, or a combination of both. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Carbon isotope changes during most of Late Ordovician time (from the mid-Caradoc Kinnekulle K-bentonite until the beginning of the Silurian) were investigated. As the corresponding sequence of rocks is stratigraphically nearly complete in Estonia, an attempt was made to use it to elaborate the general pattern of carbon isotope changes in the Late Ordovician. Complications were caused by several local or regional hiatuses in the middle and late Caradoc and Hirnantian. A total of 385 whole rock samples were studied from eight drill cores in northern and central Estonia. The following positive carbon isotope events were observed: (1) the mid-Caradoc excursion (peak $\delta$ 13C value 2.2‰) in the uppermost part of the Keila Stage, also known in Sweden; (2) the first late Caradoc excursion (1.9‰) in the lower part of the Rakvere Stage; (3) the second late Caradoc excursion (2.4‰) in the upper part of the Nabala Stage; (4) the early Ashgill excursion (2.5‰) in the lowermost part of the Pirgu Stage; (5) the widely known large Hirnantian excursion (in Estonia the peak value reaches 6.7‰) in the Porkuni Stage. The study interval comprises a long (∼10 Ma) period characterized by low-magnitude carbon isotope changes and a following brief (∼2 Ma) interval with large changes. No obvious lithological preference for hosting the positive shifts was recorded. In principle, the $\delta$ 13C values exceeding the background values may occur in all types of rocks present in a sedimentary basin. Several $\delta$ 13C positive excursions (values 1.5‰ to 3‰) in the Mohawkian of North America are evidence that the minor Caradoc and early Ashgill $\delta$ 13C positive shifts in Baltoscandia may have counterparts in Laurentia. If correctly correlated, these shifts may have global significance. The Hirnantian excursion is usually linked to a major glacial event, even if some carbon cycling mechanisms are not completely understood. The environmental causes suggested for the earlier minor shifts range from global climatic and glacial events to very local changes in basin regime and sea level. Our study supports the primary role of climatic or climatically triggered oceanic processes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A study of the Upper Ordovician-Lower Silurian strata in J{\"{a}}mtland, central Sweden, shows that large-scale changes in shelf deposition took place close to the systems boundary. These changes include unconformity development and the replacement of a siliciclastic shelf with a carbonate-dominated shelf, suggesting the interaction of allocyclic controls such as changing eustatic sea-level and climate. The 6-m-thick Ede Formation is a key lithosome for interpretation of this transition. Its sediments were deposited in the Caledonian foreland basin, situated east of the closing Iapetus Ocean on the western margin of the Baltic craton. A major part of the late Caradoc to late Ashgill (into the Hirnantian) was characterised by continuous and uniform deposition over wide areas (Kogsta Formation), whereas erosional surfaces and complex lateral facies relationships characterise the Ordovician-Silurian boundary strata (Ede Formation and lateral equivalents). The Ede Formation represents the end of terrigenous deposition, which in the middle Aeronian was followed by regional expansion of carbonate deposition (Berge Formation). A syn-sedimentary erosional surface, with at least 1 m of relief locally, forms the lower boundary of the Ede Formation. This surface is overlain by two types of conglomerate. Lower parts of the Ede Formation consist of medium to thick-bedded quartzites. A second erosional surface with only minor (few centimetres) relief occurs on top of these quartzites. The upper parts of the Ede Formation consist of a thin, basal favositid biostrome overlain by thin bedded, calcareous sandstones, limestones and intensely bioturbated shales. Analysis of stratigraphic boundaries and the facies succession suggests that the lower Ede Formation represents a major downward shift in coastal onlap and by-pass sedimentation that created the lower erosional surface. The erosional surface in the middle of the Ede Formation is inferred to have formed during the subsequent maximum lowstand or as a ravinement surface, and is interpreted as an unconformity. The succession is subdivided into four facies associations, each corresponding to a specific systems tract: (a) a Shale-Siltstone Association (uppermost Kogsta Formation), deposited during a highstand situation in mid-outer shelf areas; (b) a Quartzite Association (the lower Ede Formation), deposited during forced regression in a shoreface environment; (c) a Mixed Carbonate-Siliciclastic Association (the upper Ede Formation), deposited during transgression in a wave-dominated, proximal shelf environment when clastic supply was reduced; and (d) a Micritic Limestone Association (lowermost Berge Formation), deposited during a second highstand situation in a low-energy, offshore environment. Conodont data, together with a previously reported Hirnantia fauna, constrain the position of the Ordovician-Silurian boundary to the lower 1.65 m of the Ede Formation, or less likely, to the uppermost metre of the underlying Kogsta Formation, i.e., within a 2.65-m-thick uncertainty interval. The base of the Berge Formation is about 4 m above the top of the uncertainty interval, and is dated as being mid-Aeronian in age, suggesting condensation and/or a hiatus close to, or at, the Ordovician-Silurian boundary. These data tie the unconformity and the regional facies change from a siliciclastic to a carbonate-dominated shelf to Late Ordovician-Early Silurian eustatic and climatic changes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A model of the global biogeochemical cycles coupled to a energy-balance climate model (the COMBINE model) is used to identify the causes of two large $\delta$13C value excursions across the Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) boundary. We test a scenario that links the sea-level rise to stratification of the Proto-Tethys ocean through the formation of warm saline deep waters in extended epicontinental seas. Even though this scenario can produce dysoxia below 100 m depth, it fails to increase the global burial flux of organic carbon and thus seawater $\delta$13C values, since stratification of the ocean leads to decreased productivity in surface waters. Several scenarios postulating a continental origin of the perturbations in the Late Devonian biogeochemical cycles are then tested. We found that weathering of platform carbonates exposed during the Early Famennian sea-level fall can account for a maximum positive shift in $\delta$13C value of +0.7‰ at the end of the sea-level fall episode. Another +1.0‰ increase in $\delta$ 13C might originate from rapid spreading of vascular land plants near the F-F boundary, postulating that higher plants globally increased the weatherability of continental surface, and that colonized continental area increased by 30% across the F-F boundary. Finally, the $\delta$13C excursion observed at the base of Upper rhenana Zone and the rapid increase of the carbon isotope ratios at the F-F boundary require an increase of phosphorus delivery to the ocean by 40%, coeval with the sea-level rises. Once the calculated $\delta$13C values are in agreement with the measured data, the COMBINE model calculates a decrease in atmospheric pCO2 from pre-perturbation 2925 ppmv in the Lower rhenana conodont Zone to 1560 ppmv in the Upper triangularis Zone. This decrease in pCO2 is due to the increase in burial of organic matter during the Kellwasser events, and increased continental weatherability triggered by the spreading of continental vascular plants. These changes occur within 4 million years. The corresponding global climatic cooling reaches 4.4°C at the pole, and 2.1°C at the equator. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The sedimentary record and worldwide palaeontological and isotopic data support the existence of short-lived, latest Ordovician (Hirnantian) ice sheets over western Gondwanaland. Located in the cratonic Taoudeni Basin (West Africa), the study areas are distributed across a 500-km-long profile ranging from ice-proximal to ice-distal depositional conditions (Hodh and Adrar areas, respectively; central and northwestern Mauritania). Glaciation-related but mainly non-glacial deposits form the Tichitt Group, which rests upon Cambrian-Ordovician rocks on top of a basin-wide erosional surface. The glacial record consists of depositional successions bound by unconformities of glacial origin in ice-proximal areas, or of sub-aerial origin in ice-distal areas. Facies associations reflect a variety of environments (braided streams, flood-dominated alluvial plains, delta plain to delta slope, tidal or storm-wave influenced shallow-marine settings). The upper bounding surface of the Tichitt Group generally corresponds to a wave-ravinement surface, overlain by uppermost Ordovician to lower Silurian shales. Four, inter-regionally distributed units are vertically superimposed and laterally juxtaposed. A unit is a hundreds of kilometres long sedimentary body, up to 100 m thick, which is laterally discontinuous as it typically infills palaeodepressions or palaeovalleys. In ice-proximal areas, aggrading fluvial deposits are identified. Coarse-grained braided stream deposits, including glacial surfaces related to minor glacial advances, predominate upstream. Downstream, finer-grained flood-dominated fluvial deposits are identified. In ice-distal areas, thick fluvial-dominated delta sediments are deposited. Each of the four units, of climatic significance, and built under high accommodation conditions, records a recession stage of the northern Gondwana ice sheet following a major glacial advance. The overall backstepping of the glacial units characterises the large-scale depositional architecture. The fourth unit, characterised by glaciomarine deposits in ice-proximal areas, and non-glacial, bioturbated storm-dominated deposits in ice-distal areas, records the final retreat of the northern Gondwana ice sheet. The lower bounding surface of this later glacial unit marks a Late Hirnantian major transgressive surface of a Late Ordovician-Silurian relative sea-level rise starting before the glaciation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

An increase in guild and taxonomic diversity was observed with the addition of several new higher taxa in the late Early Triassic (Spathian) to the almost exclusively molluscan faunas of the earlier Early Triassic (Nammalian). Potential "disaster forms" (the inarticulate brachiopod, Lingula, and the paper pecten, Claraia) dominated the earliest Early Triassic faunas (Griesbachian) and even occurred in the late Early Triassic (normal marine stromatolites). Comparison with data on faunas from the Permian and Triassic suggests that even the most diverse Early Triassic faunas (in the Spathian) were rather low in guild diversity and species richness. These characteristics of genera and paleocommunities in the Early Triassic may be typical of mass extinction aftermaths. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Neritic carbonates (NC) were one of the most prominent facies of the Peri-Tethyan domain. From the Moscovian to the end of Tertiary times, most parts of the area concerned were included in, or in the vicinity of, the intertropical domain, favourable to the deposition of NC. These optimal latitudinal conditions were strengthened by warm surface currents which globally ran from east westward in this part of the Tethyan realm. The settlement of NC was enhanced by the existence of huge shallow marine platforms on the southern and northern Peri-Tethyan margins and on isolated oceanic highs as well. Peri-Tethys atlas maps, explanatory notes and validation points have provided data on the main biological, sedimentological, geographical, and environmental features of NC. Areas covered by NC have been calculated from 20 maps encompassing the Moscovian to the Piacenzian/Gelasian, using an Image Analysis Optilab system. The latitudinal distribution and the total area covered by NC for each time slice have been plotted with reference to global factors driving the carbonate factory. Variations of areas through time have been analysed and discussed with respect to regional palaeogeographic conditions. Global factors driving the NC sedimentation in Peri-Tethyan areas have been successively examined. The dominant skeletal and non-skeletal mineralogy on carbonate deposition has been evaluated. Photozoan organisms have been dominant contributors; however, deposition of temperate Heterozoan carbonates in northern latitudes occurred during Artinskian, Wordian, Maastrichtian and Tertiary times. Adverse conditions of siliciclastic inputs on carbonate deposition settled at certain periods but many Peri-Tethyan NC areas faced without damage terrigenous belts. Sea level highstands generally allowed wide NC areas to form, but certain time intervals had about the same amount of area covered by NC, despite opposite - low vs high - eustatic stillstand. Latitudinal enlargement of NC areas was enhanced during Mesozoic and Early Cainozoic greenhouse regimes, while a latitudinal constriction occurred during Artinskian, Wordian and late Tertiary times, in relation to an icehouse mode. During early Jurassic, middle Cretaceous and early Tertiary times, ocean circulation seems to have controlled latitudinal shifts of the NC areas. Abrupt increases or reductions of areas covered by NC coincided with the onset of atmospheric-controlling magmatic events or of sudden oceanic events with climatic implications. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {New field data demonstrate that during the Late Ordovician (Hirnantian) glaciation, an ice sheet expanding northwestwards over the Anti-Atlas range reached into the southern Meseta of northern Morocco. Its growth to a glacial maximum position resulted in extensive subglacial erosion and deformation including the development of soft-sediment striated surfaces and streamlined subglacial bedforms preserved between the High Atlas of Marrakech and Rehamna. These features imply that this ice mass extended > 200 km further than previously thought, and increase its size by at least ca. 190, 000 km 2 (comparable in area to the UK). Correlation between a measured section in the High Atlas of Marrakech and that of the southern Meseta identifies sedimentary evolution within an ice-contact system common to both. These findings imply that the West African Craton and northern Morocco were in full glaciological communication during the latest Ordovician. Palaeogeographic reconstruction shows that beyond the ice sheet, south and southeastward palaeoslopes persisted on the shelf. A palaeohigh beyond the main ice sheet was a major source for sand, feeding delta systems that grew along the shelf as far as the shelf break. This palaeohigh probably formed as a result of rift shoulder uplift and supported a satellite ice mass. In the eastern Meseta, a thick (350 m) underflow-dominated deep-marine fan was fed both from this shelf delta system and from glaciogenic debris derived from the main ice sheet. The occurrence of this unexpected deep-marine area in northern Morocco implies that continued northward advance of the ice sheet was hampered by a dramatic break in bathymetry. Two depositional units are recognised across the Meseta, containing four distinct sedimentary cycles, each recognised as a glacioeustatic response to the waxing and waning of ice masses elsewhere in West Gondwana. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The complete Anticosti sequence has been collected for conodonts to provide a database of over 77 600 conodonts derived from 272 samples through the 800-1100 m sequence. This paper uses a statistical analysis of the database to establish the pattern of conodont communities and their interpreted water depths. This allows the establishment of a eustatic sea level curve for the sequence. This curve is in general agreement with those of the earlier workers, but is more detailed and better constrained stratigraphically given the large sampling program. The curve reflects more oscillating sea level changes for the whole sequence than those constructed earlier, and different water depths for certain intervals from those established earlier. The curve is valuable given that the Anticosti sequence is one of the most complete in the world for this interval, and its divergence from global eustatic curves for this interval is noted. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

In south China a positive excursion in $\delta$ 13 C org is associated with the latter part of the positive $\delta$ 13 C carb excursion and closely resembles trends from Iowa and Pennsylvania that have been interpreted to reflect a lowering of atmospheric pCO 2 levels. The $\delta$ 13 C org trends from Oklahoma and West Virginia differ significantly from what is observed in China. This likely indicates that local changes in nutrient cycling and phytoplankton growth rates were the dominant control on 12 C fractionation in Oklahoma and West Virginia, masking a possible global signal of lowered atmospheric pCO 2 levels observed in China. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The record of the Ordovician-Silurian transition within the southern Peru-Bolivia Palaeozoic basin (extending across Peru, Bolivia and northern Argentina) is characterized by a diamictite-bearing unit which overlies several different Ordovician units, and underlies mid Silurian shales. We review the lithostratigraphy, sedimentology and biostratigraphy of this unit, revising stratigraphic relationships and several ideas and interpretations previously proposed. Analysis of facies and lithofacies associations allow for a reinterpretation of sedimentary processes and environments involved during its deposition. Turbidite and shale interbeds within the diamictites indicate a deep marine environment, with interbedded mud flows, debris flows, slumps and large displaced slabs providing evidence for sediment instability and resedimentation. Chitinozoan biostratigraphy indicates a Llandovery age, in contrast with previous proposals of a Hirnantian age, and suggests the need for more detailed sedimentologic and biostratigraphic studies, and a reassessment of this diamictite unit in relation to adjacent regions in South America. The resedimented character of the deposit explains some of the Ordovician fauna previously described, which must be considered as recycled from underlying units. In situ fauna needs to be reassessed, as it may be endemic, diachronic and/or indicative of migrations within Gondwana. Glacially-faceted and striated clasts, as well as large granitoid boulders within the resedimented materials, provide evidence for glaciation of the source area, and are interpreted as recycled from former glacigenic deposits. The evidence found in the Central Andes indicates a glaciomarine origin for the diamictites and corroborates glaciation of a western source area prior to the late Llandovery (Telychian). The precise age of glaciation in this part of Gondwana cannot be confirmed do to a lack of true tillites. Tectonic deformation and the resulting relief are respectively identified as the origin for sediment instability and for local glaciation along the active margin of western Gondwana during the Late Ordovician and Early Silurian. The new data imply that the Ordovician-Silurian boundary was not preserved in some areas of the basin, and that an erosional hiatus (disconformity with variable regional significance) is present between different Ordovician units and the diamictite unit. Late Ordovician (?late Caradoc-?early Ashgill) euxinic black shales locally present in the central Altiplano and Eastern Cordillera of Bolivia may represent the youngest Ordovician unit in the region, and more research should be focused on them. Paleogeographic reconstruction of the Early Silurian Peru-Bolivia Basin depicts the extension of the diamictite unit southwards into northern Argentina and western Paraguay, connecting with the Paran{\'{a}} basin through the Asunci{\'{o}}n Arch. To the north it continued into northern Peru and Ecuador, connecting with the Silurian record in Colombia and Venezuela, and to the northeast into Brazil (Solim{\~{o}}es and Amazonas basins). The sedimentary record of glaciation in the Peru-Bolivia basin was due to the development of local ice fields to the west of the basin, related with tectonism and resulting reliefs along the active margin of Gondwana, and probably did not coincide with the development of the North African late Ashgillian ice cap. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

They are assigned to the new ichnospecies Cylindrichnus helix, and they are interpreted as dwellings of commensal annelid worms.

abstract = {The upper Ordovician succession of Jordan was located ∼60°S, less than 100 km from the Hirnantian ice sheet margin. New graptolite dates indicate glaciation ended in Jordan in the late Hirnantian (persculptus Biozone). The succession records two glacial advances within the Ammar Formation and the subsequent deglaciations. Organic-rich black shales (Batra Formation) form part of the final deglacial transgressive succession that in-filled an existing low stand glacial continental shelf topography. The base of the black shale is coincident with the maximum flooding surface. During transgression, interfluves and sub-basin margins were breached and black shale deposition expanded rapidly across the region. The top of the black shales coincides with peak highstand. The "expanding puddle model" (sensu Wignall) for black shale deposition, adapted for the peri-glacial setting, provides the best explanation for this sequence of events. We propose a hypothesis in which anoxic conditions were initiated beneath the halocline in a salinity stratified water column; a fresher surface layer resulted from ice meltwater generated during early deglaciation. During the initial stages of marine incursion, nutrients in the monimolimnion were isolated from the euphotic zone by the halocline. Increasing total organic carbon (TOC) and $\delta$13Corg up section indicates the organic carbon content of the shales was controlled mainly by increasing bioproductivity in the mixolimnion (the Strakhov model). Mixolimnion nutrient levels were sustained by a continual and increasing supply of meltwater-derived nutrients, modulated by obliquity changes in high latitude insolation. Anoxia was sustained over tens to hundreds of thousands of years. The formation of black shales on the north Gondwana shelf was little different to those observed in modern black shale environments, suggesting that it was the nature of the Ordovician seas that pre-disposed them to anoxia. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Marine carbonates from three biostratigraphically well-dated Silurian sections from the mid-continent of North America were analyzed for carbon isotopic ($\delta$13Ccarb) study. The early Wenlock positive carbon isotope excursion (Ireviken Excursion) is recorded in three sections from Tennessee, Iowa, and Ohio, with values of >+4.5‰. This global shift in the carbon isotopic ratio of marine waters began during a protracted extinction event (Ireviken Event) that spanned the Llandovery-Wenlock boundary. Although several oceanographic models have been developed to account for the coincident changes in lithology, biology, and carbon isotope stratigraphy during this interval of the Silurian, their proposed causal connections among glaciation, oceanography, primary productivity, and the global carbon cycle remain a matter of debate. This investigation provides carbon isotopic and lithologic evidence that the Ireviken Excursion occurred during a time of relatively oligotrophic conditions, a third order transgressive- regressive cycle, and increased carbonate production throughout the mid-continent of North America. The Ireviken Excursion is recorded in relatively pure carbonate sequences and is immediately preceded by a significant unconformity in each of the measured sections. It is proposed that the Ireviken Excursion was the product of sequestration and burial of 12C in deep water as a result of altered deep ocean circulation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In the upper Ordovician glaciogenic rocks of West Gondwana, many soft-sediment deformation structures are attributed to glaciotectonic processes. However, little is known about the subglacial and ice-marginal processes associated with this ice sheet. A systematic description and interpretation of these soft-sediment deformation structures is supplemented by a comparison with Late Quaternary and Modern glacial settings to provide qualitative constraints on the character of ancient subglacial thermal regimes. Soft-sediment striations were formed by discontinuous, shear-induced deformation beneath an ice sheet that oscillated between warm and cold-based thermal regimes. Beneath warm-based ice, coupling across the ice-bed interface was poor with sliding and loading occurring at this surface. Loading of soft, waterlogged sediments allowed the development of fluted surfaces, which are also associated with the formation of truncated folded zones. During times of cold thermal regimes, coupling across the ice-bed interface was enhanced by freezing, which caused changes in the position of the freezing front. These discontinuous changes, coupled with sustained subglacial shearing, resulted in the development of stacked, soft-sediment striated surfaces. In areas where the subglacial substrate had an irregular topography, complex shear zones formed that comprised stacked duplex systems interlayered with highly strained units preserving pervasive, folded lineations. At the ice front, large glaciotectonic deformation structures (comparable with push moraines) developed during sustained periods of (re)advance that created composite thrust and fold systems. Deformation was transmitted for up to 1 km from the ice front and reduced in intensity with distance. Other deformation structures include dome-like folds that consist of central anticlines (30 to 70 m in width) with tight rim synclines that formed by the load-induced, diapiric intrusion of muds. An ice-sheet surging mechanism is inferred for the development of composite thrust and fold systems and the coeval sediment diapirs. These surges potentially caused the widespread reorganisation of a glacial load resulting in the pro- to subglacial extrusion of soft sediments. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Subphylum Blastozoa represents more than one third of the early Palaeozoic echinoderm fauna. A comprehensive database including all records of blastozoans was built to provide quantitative analyses of palaeogeography and diversity patterns and processes, for the 10 classes currently included in this subphylum during the early Palaeozoic. The global pattern of taxonomic diversity shows two peaks during the Cambrian Series 3 and the Late Ordovician intervals. In Cambrian times, the high taxonomic diversity seems to be related with a high turnover rate and a high endemicity of blastozoan genera, whereas in Ordovician times, the rise in diversity is associated with a low endemicity and a low turnover rate. The gradual increase of Ordovician diversity can be explained by the progressive geographic extension of blastozoan genera onto most palaeocontinental margins, associated to the long-term gradual sea level rise. This global pattern is subdivided into local trends to compare the relative influence of regional distributional patterns. Blastozoans occurred mainly on Gondwanan and Laurentian margins during the Cambrian. In both Ordovician and Silurian times, blastozoans colonised different provinces, characterised by varied latitudinal position and environmental conditions: the Laurentian province was mainly located in the equatorial latitudes (temperate to warm waters, mainly carbonate platforms), and both the northwestern peri-Gondwanan and Asian provinces, in the intermediate to high latitudes (temperate to cold water, mainly siliciclastic environments). After the Hirnantian mass extinction, blastozoans finally recovered chiefly on Laurentian margins, where climate and environmental conditions were probably more favourable. The two diversification events recorded for blastozoans in the early Palaeozoic concerned two distinct evolutionary faunas (Cambrian Evolutionary Fauna vs. Palaeozoic Evolutionary Fauna). They were driven by distinct processes, even if the Ordovician diversification had indeed started during the middle Furongian with a medium origination event. Difference in processes might be related to the evolution of global environmental/climatic conditions coupled with the position of continental masses. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The 'Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event' (GOBE) saw a spectacular increase in marine biodiversity at all taxonomic levels largely within the phyla established much earlier during the so-called 'Cambrian Explosion'. The diversification was probably the result of a combination of several geological and biological processes and the positive feedbacks resulting from them. The present paper reviews the palaeoecological dimension of the GOBE. It involved major increases in $\alpha$, {\ss} and $\gamma$ biodiversity largely associated with the rise of the Paleozoic Evolutionary Fauna dominated by suspension feeders and involving a greater occupation of ecospace and more complex ecological structures in the Ecological Evolutionary Units P1 and P2. In the benthos, these include more complex food webs than those of the Cambrian, greater tiering, especially above the sediment-water interface, and the development of guild structures indicating increased competition between taxa for particular resources. The Ordovician is characterized by a profound change in reef composition, with a switch from microbial-dominated reefs in the Early and Middle Ordovician to metazoan-dominated reefs in the Late Ordovician. Increases in complexity of deep-water trace fossil assemblages began in the Early Ordovician and mark the increasing exploitation in that environment and the development of hardgrounds permitted bioerosion and encrusting strategies together with the appearance of cryptic communities.Within the water column, the GOBE involved a significant increase in the diversity of the phytoplankton and the development of a diverse zooplankton (including planktotrophic larvae from a range of invertebrate clades). This revolution in the plankton enabled the establishment of a diverse fauna of pelagic vertebrates, molluscs and arthropods and promoted the rise of suspension feeders in the benthos. An escalation amongst predators and thus community evolution may also have been a major driver of biodiversification. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sea level is not static, but liable to fluctuations due to addition or subtraction of water in the world's oceans, as well as changes to the shape and holding capacity of ocean basins. Relative changes in sea level are well supported by the rock record on a regional scale. Whether or not global (eustatic) changes are evident and how frequently they occurred during any given interval of time is a matter of contention among stratigraphers. Opinions have evolved over the last century with arguments based on refinements in biostratigraphy, chemostratigraphy, radiometric dating, and conceptual advances in sequence stratigraphy derived from technological advances in seismic stratigraphy. The Pulsation Theory of A.W. Grabau (1936) attributed to Paleozoic strata a global history of 11 highstands distributed through a sequence with 21 subdivisions. In 1977, Peter Vail and associates from the Exxon Production Research Company independently interpreted a similar Paleozoic history showing 10 second-order highstands but distributed over 19 subdivisions. Vail's approach was model-based and followed a deductive path, while Grabau's was based on inductive reasoning. Recent refinements in a Paleozoic sea-level curve by Haq and Schutter (2008) are based on the same deductive approach taken by the Vail group, but pinned to patterns in sequence stratigraphy. Drawing on the Silurian System as a Paleozoic sample, the timing, frequency, and magnitude of sea-level highstands deduced by Haq and Schutter are compared with those promulgated by the author from the mid-1980s onward using empirical evidence more in line with Grabau's methodology. Both apply the concept of geographic reference areas, but Haq and Schutter identify 50% more Silurian highstands over an interval lasting 27.7 million. years.

abstract = {An exceptional exposure of Late Ordovician glaciogenic sediments crops out in Dider, SE Algeria, within the Tassili N'Ajjer region. The sediments consist of sandstones and diamictites sandwiched between a Mid Ordovician fluvial and tidal sandstone (In Tahouite Formation) below and Early Silurian shale (Oued Imirhou Formation) above. Stratigraphic discontinuities within the Late Ordovician glaciogene succession include palaeovalley incisions and glacially striated pavements. Striation and fluting of a soft-bedded sediment beneath an ancient ice sheet is supported by abundant dewatering structures and soft-sediment gouges interpreted to have been produced by the action of stone ploughing. In Dider, two types of previously undescribed circular structures sit in negative relief on this glacial pavement, namely 1) paired thumb-shaped impressions 2. cm in diameter and 3. mm in depth, and 2) a 5. cm wide impression with 3 segmented nested cycles. A framboid or aggregate origin may be appropriate for the smaller of the features but the larger impression is interpreted as biogenic: internal complexity is characteristic, discounting concretion moulds and water escape structures. A biogenic origin as a coelenterate resting trace is proposed with speculation on conditions of exceptional preservation in an ancient periglacial environment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cretaceous black shales deposited under severe oxygen-depletion are carriers of proxy signals for paleoenvironmental conditions. Using high-resolution patterns of iron and sulfur speciation, stable sulfur isotope discrimination, and trace element enrichment from black shale sequences of Sites 1258 and 1260 we identified alterations of the depositional environment during the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary Event (OAE 2) in the southern North Atlantic (ODP Leg 207, Demerara Rise). Changes in redox-conditions are suggested by high ratios of reactive to total iron which indicate that pyrite was formed both in the water column and within the sediment. This corresponds to euxinic paleoenvironmental conditions with at least temporarily free dissolved sulfide in the water column, a situation similar to the modern deep Black Sea. In addition, besides fixation of sulfide as iron sulfide, organic matter acted as an important sulfur trap during early diagenesis. Stable sulfur isotope fractionation went through a minimum within the OAE 2 interval indicating enhanced sulfur isotope discrimination during highest burial of organic matter (OM) potentially due to lower burial efficiency of reduced sulfur and/or a higher contributions from the oxidative part of the sulfur cycle (e.g., in the water column or the surface sediments). Elevated Fe/Al and Co/Al values within the Cenomanian/Turonian interval confirm euxinic conditions but, at the same time, require a zone where reducing but non-sulfidic conditions prevail, allowing reductive Fe and Co mobilization in oxygen-depleted nearshore sediments. The existence of an expanded oxygen-minimum-zone (OMZ) is demonstrated by extremely low Mn/Al ratios. A change in the trace metal (TM) inventory of seawater is postulated from a decline in seawater derived TM enrichment. Because hypoxic or even euxinic environments form an important sink for TM, the enlargement of euxinic depositional areas at the global onset of black shale deposition during OAE 2 have likely led to a drawdown of the seawater TM reservoir. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Multiple lines of evidence indicate that Earth's land masses became green some 2.7 Ga ago, about 1 billion years after the advent of life. About 2.2 billion years later, land plants abruptly appear in the fossil record and diversify marking the onset of ecologically complex terrestrial communities that persist to the present day. Given this long history of land colonization, surprisingly few studies report direct fossil evidence of emergent vegetation prior to the continuous record of life on land that starts in the mid-Silurian (ca. 420-425 Ma ago). Here we compare stable carbon isotope signatures of fossils from seven Ordovician-Silurian (450-420 Ma old) Appalachian biotas with signatures of coeval marine organic matter and with stable carbon isotope values predicted for Ordovician and Silurian liverworts (BRYOCARB model). The comparisons support a terrestrial origin for fossils in six of the biotas analyzed, and indicate that some of the fossils represent bryophyte-grade plants. Our results demonstrate that extensive land floras pre-dated the advent of vascular plants by at least 25 Ma. The Appalachian fossils represent the oldest direct evidence of widespread colonization of continents. These findings provide a new search image for macrofossil assemblages that contain the earliest stages of land plant evolution. We anticipate they will fuel renewed efforts to search for direct fossil evidence to track the origin of land plants and eukaryotic life on continents further back in geologic time. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report geological and organic geochemical results that provide evidence for an increase in photic zone primary productivity during ice melting. The decay of this organic matter through oxidative respiration resulted in euxinia, which enhanced the potential for organic matter preservation.

Evidence from sedimentological, faunal, and geochemical data from South China, as well as the evidence of glacial sediments in North Africa, all suggests a short-lived glaciation of $\sim$ 1 Ma in the Ordovician South Pole region, consisting of at least two major pulses.

abstract = {Paired measurements of bulk carbonate ($\delta$13Ccarb), organic matter ($\delta$13Corg), and their difference ($\Delta$13C) can be used to estimate changes in isotopic fractionation through time as a function of O2/CO2 in the atmosphere. However, because local scale processes can also affect $\Delta$13C, it is essential to compare sections from widely separated water masses. Here we present new $\delta$13Corg data from Ordovician carbonate rocks from the Great Basin, Oklahoma, and Appalachian Basin and compare with published $\delta$13Ccarb records from these sections and paired $\delta$13C values from other carbonate successions around North America. These new data complement previous studies that focused on Upper Ordovician $\delta$13Ccarb excursions and now provide a composite Ordovician $\delta$13Corg record. New Lower Ordovician (Tremadocian Stage) $\delta$13Corg data range from ca. − 26 to − 28‰, decreasing throughout the Lower–Middle Ordovician (Floian–Dapingian Stages) to ca. − 29 to − 31‰. $\delta$13Corg values remain at their lowest throughout the Sandbian and are similar to other published Upper Ordovician (Sandbian–Katian) $\delta$13Corg data from North America. $\Delta$13C values from well-preserved intervals generally vary between + 26 to + 28‰ throughout the Lower to Middle Ordovician (Tremadocian to early Darriwilian), but increase to + 31‰ during the mid–late Darriwilian and mid Sandbian, similar to published data from younger Late Ordovician positive $\delta$13C excursions known as the Guttenberg (GICE) and Hirnantian (HICE) events. The overall $\Delta$13C trend shows a $\sim$ 3‰ increase throughout the Early–Middle Ordovician and coincides with a previously interpreted period of ocean cooling and some of the earliest pulses of global biodiversity of marine invertebrates and planktonic organisms. Modeling studies predict that pCO2 decreased during this time, suggesting that the effect of pCO2 on $\Delta$13C may have been overwhelmed by other controls, such as an in increase in pO2 or a higher O2/CO2 ratio during this biodiversification event.},

abstract = {Campanian sediments from two French sedimentary basins were studied, using clay mineralogy and stable isotope ($\delta$13C and $\delta$18O) geochemistry, in order to investigate the Late Campanian Event. The clay fraction of the Campanian sediments from the Tercis-les-Bains section (Aquitaine Basin) and from the Poigny borehole (Paris Basin) is mainly composed of smectite. This background sedimentation was, however, interrupted during the Upper Campanian in the two basins by a substantial increase in detrital inputs, including illite, kaolinite, and chlorite at Tercis-les-Bains, and illite at Poigny. This detrital event, resulting from the enhanced erosion of nearby continental areas triggered by increasing runoff, has also been recognized in the Tethys and South Atlantic oceans. It coincided with a global negative carbon isotope excursion, the Late Campanian Event (LCE). Carbon isotope stratigraphy was used to correlate the two basins with previously studied sections from distant areas. Spectral analysis of the bulk $\delta$13C from Tercis-les-Bains suggests a duration of ca. 400 kyr for a pre-LCE negative excursion and ca. 800-900 kyr for the LCE sensu stricto. The detrital event, as characterized by clay mineralogy, spans the interval that comprises the pre-LCE and the LCE, with a duration of 1.3 Myr. Intensification of continental erosion during the LCE may have resulted either from the Late Campanian polyplocum regression and/or from a regional tectonic pulse that triggered the emersion of previous submerged shelf areas and the increase of silicate erosion. As the LCE seems to be recorded at a large geographic scale, it is proposed here that enhanced chemical weathering and an associated decrease in atmospheric pCO2 levels could have contributed to the long-term Late Cretaceous cooling trend.},

abstract = {The uppermost Sandbian-lower Katian stratigraphic record documents a critical time period in Earth history. Lithological evidence and geochemical proxy records suggest that the uppermost Sandbian-lower Katian interval could represent a transitional phase from a long Cambrian-Ordovician greenhouse world to the Late Ordovician icehouse world. To examine this interval of Earth's history, oxygen isotopes of conodont apatite from the Bromide and Viola Springs Formations in southern Oklahoma were analyzed in order to provide sea-surface temperature estimates at a location that had little influence by terrigenous sedimentation. Our results are inconsistent with 1) previous suggestions that global cooling occurred across a prominent sequence boundary close to the Sandbian-Katian boundary across North America and 2) the hypothesis that there is a direct connection between volcanic mega eruption(s) and a significant long term impact on climate during the Sandbian-Katian of Laurentia. Furthermore, $\delta$ 18O values spanning the Guttenberg Carbon Isotope Excursion (GICE), an interval that has been interpreted as evidence for an early onset of the Late Ordovician glaciation, are variable. A +1.5‰ $\delta$ 18O shift is observed in the lower GICE that is followed by a return to $\delta$ 18O values that fluctuate around a mean of 19.0‰ in the upper GICE. Together, these observations suggest a short-lived cooling event within the lower GICE. This cooling event may represent enhanced carbon burial and drawdown of atmospheric pCO 2 followed by a return to more stable low-latitude temperatures in the upper GICE. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Despite marine geochemical records indicating widespread oxygenation of the biosphere in the terminal Neoproterozoic Era, Late Cambrian records point to the persistence of deep-water anoxia and potential for development of euxinic conditions. The Late Cambrian SPICE (Steptoean Positive Carbon-Isotope Excursion) event, however, is a globally recognized chemostratigraphic marker that likely represents significant organic carbon burial and subsequent liberation of oxygen to the biosphere. Here, we present high-resolution carbon and sulfur isotope profiles from Early to Middle Ordovician carbonate rocks from the Argentine Precordillera and Western Newfoundland to constrain oceanic redox conditions in the post-SPICE world. Marine C-isotope profiles record relatively stable behavior (excursions <3‰) that is characteristic of greenhouse climates. Marine S-isotope profiles record short-term (<10 6 yr), rhythmic variation superimposed over a longer term ($\sim$10 7 yr) signal. Substantial isotopic heterogeneity between average S-isotope values of different sections (15-25‰) suggests the Ordovician marine sulfate reservoir was not well mixed, indicating a low marine sulfate concentration (likely <2mM or less than 10% modern). Short-term variation (7‰ excursions over 1Myr) is consistent with a small sulfate reservoir size and is best explained by the rhythmic oxidation of a deep-water reactive HS - reservoir. Greenhouse intervals, such as that represented by the Ordovician ocean, are often associated with deep-water anoxia, and the presence of a persistent, deep water HS - reservoir that is fed through bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) is not unexpected. A broadly sympathetic relationship between carbon and sulfur isotope systems over long time scales ($\sim$10 7 yr) suggests that the extent of deep-ocean euxinia was moderated by changes in organic productivity, which fueled BSR and production of reduced sulfide species. By contrast, short-term (<10 6 yr) sulfur isotope variation appears to be decoupled from the marine carbon-isotope signal. We suggest that this apparent decoupling reflects a combination of elevated pCO 2 during greenhouse times-which acts to dampen C-isotope response-and relatively small-scale fluctuations in organic productivity that affected the position of the marine oxycline and the balance of HS - production and reoxidation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Ma. Integration of petrographic, geochemical, and time series data provides new insights regarding the fluxes of major and trace components to the sediment as well as environmental conditions in both the deep and intermediate water masses at each study site. The Ubara section was located in a high-productivity peri-equatorial location, whereas the Gujo-Hachiman section was located in a moderate-productivity location at some distance from the paleoequator. An upward transition from gray organic-poor cherts to black siliceous mudstones at both sites occurred in conjunction with increased primary productivity, intensified euxinia within the oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ), and decimation of the radiolarian zooplankton community. Euxinia in the OMZ of the equatorial Panthalassic Ocean developed episodically for a $\sim$. 200-250. kyr interval during the Late Permian, followed by an abrupt intensification and lateral expansion of the OMZ around the Permian-Triassic boundary. Throughout the study interval, bottom waters at both sites remained mostly suboxic, a finding that counters hypotheses of development of a "superanoxic" Permo-Triassic deep ocean as a consequence of stagnation of oceanic overturning circulation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Two sustained rises in marine biodiversity have taken place during the Phanerozoic: one in the Early Palaeozoic and one beginning in the early Mesozoic (e.g. Owen and Crame, 2002). The first of these encompasses both the ‘Cambrian Explosion' (e.g. Butterfield, 2001) and the ‘Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event' (GOBE) (e.g. [Miller, 2004], [Webby et al., 2004] and [Harper, 2006]) as part of a larger ‘Early Palaeozoic radiation' recorded between the Late Neoproterozoic and the Early Devonian (e.g. Alroy et al., 2008). While the early Cambrian was marked by new body plans and the appearance of most animal phyla, the Ordovician was when the diversity of marine life ‘exploded' at lower taxonomic levels within these phyla. The Early Palaeozoic radiation of marine organisms was interrupted by the first and second largest of the ‘Big Five' Mass Extinctions, widely correlated with the Hirnantian glaciation close to the end of the Ordovician Period and thus to an episode of major climate change (e.g. Sheehan, 2001). The very successful International Geological Correlation Programme (IGCP) project no. 410 ‘The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event' resulted in the publication of biodiversity curves for all Ordovician fossil groups (Webby et al., 2004); while its successor project, IGCP no. 503 ‘Ordovician Palaeogeography and Palaeoclimate,' concentrated on the possible drivers and triggers of this biodiversification (see Servais et al., 2009 for a summary). The present special issue of Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology is focused on the palaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental dimension of the Early Palaeozoic radiation. It largely comprises a thematic set of papers that were originally presented at the official closing meeting of IGCP 503, organised in August 2008 in Lille (France), and follows earlier special issues resulting from the project ([Munnecke and Servais, 2007] and [Owen, 2008]).

abstract = {The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) represented the largest increase in diversity in the marine biosphere during the Phanerozoic Eon, yet its causes and consequences remain poorly understood. Patterns of isotopic variation in high-resolution $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg records from a well-exposed section at Honghuayuan in South China may provide important insights regarding the GOBE. The Honghuayuan isotopic profiles, which can be correlated with C-isotopic records from contemporaneous sections globally, reveal large perturbations to the global carbon cycle during the Ordovician. A + 8‰ increase in $\delta$13Corg values in the Floian implies a large, albeit transient increase in the burial rate of organic matter during the mid-Early Ordovician that may have contributed to climatic cooling and played an important role in triggering the GOBE. A + 4‰ increase in $\delta$13Ccarb and high-frequency variation in $\delta$13Corg in the Darriwilian to Sandbian suggest a second episode of elevated organic carbon burial rates accompanied by substantial instability in the global carbon cycle during the late Middle and early Late Ordovician. This pattern may mark the onset of climate changes culminating in the end-Ordovician Hirnantian glaciation and mass extinction event that terminated the GOBE. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This comprised: (1) a pre-glacial cooling of the deep sea in the early Ashgill (Cautleyan), (2) initiation of intense thermohaline circulation in the late Rawtheyan, predating, (3) the start of the glacial maximum near the end of the Rawtheyan, and (4) rapid de-glaciation in the mid- to upper Hirnantian (lower part of the persculptus Biozone). It is proposed that the glacial maximum was triggered by a combination of negative greenhouse effect ('Monterey Hypothesis') and increasing surface albedo.

abstract = {The Hirnantian glaciation of West Gondwana produced a glacially sculpted topography, which is draped by organic-rich latest Ordovician and early Silurian 'hot shales'. Although these are the most important Early Palaeozoic source rock in North Africa, organic enrichment is distributed unevenly. For example, in Al Kufrah Basin, Libya, 'hot shales' are elusive, but outcrop analysis at the western basin demonstrates why this is the case. The topmost Mamuniyat Formation, of Hirnantian age, comprises glaciogenic sandstones, passing upward into mixed facies of the Tanezzuft Formation, which has a latest Ordovician-early Silurian age. The basal Tanezzuft Formation contains a shelly carbonate (cool-water deposits accumulated under oxygenating conditions) and bioturbated sandstone succession. Above, hummocky cross-bedded and graded sandstone intervals are intercalated with shale and siltstone (storm influx onto a muddy shelf). These are interrupted by several lonestone-bearing intervals (ice-rafted debris), a striated pavement (of subglacial origin), and manganese oxide crusts and concretions. The concretions and bioturbation imply oxygenation of the sea floor during transgression. These putative glacial deposits were deposited following the main phase of the Hirnantian glaciation, at the same stratigraphic level as 'hot shales' elsewhere in northern Gondwana. Lingering ice caps may have produced well-oxygenated marine waters precluding 'hot shale' deposition.},

abstract = {This paper describes a tectonostratigraphic model of the synrift evolution of the Early Jurassic High Atlas rift of Morocco. The model is constrained by mapping of a set of inverted extensional blocks, by facies analysis of carbonate platform and turbiditic to hemipelagic synrift deposits, and by high-resolution (n 3 100 ka) biostratigraphy of the Early Jurassic succession. The chronostratigraphic packages of the High Atlas of Rich vary significantly in thickness, facies and architecture from one tectonic block to another. Our study shows how synrift strain varied in space and time over a long time interval (14 Ma) around the High Atlas rift. Initially, in Sinemurian time, the High Atlas rift was affected by low-strain normal faulting that controlled the growth of an extensive, low-gradient carbonate platform, except in the northern domain (towards the rift axis), where hemipelagic deposition related to high-rate faulting prevailed. Subsequently, in Carixian-Domerian time, a rapid increase in accommodation space and block subsidence caused by highstrain normal faulting brought about localized drowning of the carbonate platform and the development of calciturbidites and of starved deposits towards the rift axis. During this interval, high-strain, upper-crustal normal faulting migrated rapidly (over a period of 5 Ma) towards the rift periphery. {\textcopyright} 2009 Geological Society of London.},

abstract = {Geological evidence indicates that the Sahara was glaciated by a large ice sheet c. 440 Ma ago. Two end-member theories have been proposed for the large-scale configuration of this ice mass. In the large ice-sheet hypothesis, the Sahara was covered by a continuous ice sheet that straddled North Africa-Arabia, South Africa and South America. In the small ice-sheet hypothesis, it has been argued that separate ice sheets developed in each of these areas. Taking these end-members and an ice sheet of intermediate dimensions, we investigate this problem, calculating likely ice volumes and the flux of ice to the ice margin. We find that the small ice sheet adequately accounts for the estimated magnitude of post-glacial transgression (c. 45-80 m) associated with ice-mass decay. Additionally, the notion of a North African-Arabian ice sheet within the small ice-sheet hypothesis is supported by an analysis of ice-stream fluxes across the Sahara, accounting for widespread heterogeneous flow within the ice sheet. This paper provides an independent check on the likely size and extent of Late Ordovician ice masses, with potential application to other Palaeozoic ice-sheet reconstructions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Geological Society of London.},

abstract = {The Lower Palaeozoic Haima Group of the Sultanate of Oman comprises a sequence dominated by siliciclastic rocks up to several kilometres thick and broadly divisible into two groups. The sequence is known in outline from subsurface exploration, but recent field work on outcrops in the isolated Huqf area in east-central Oman has allowed a more detailed environmental interpretation of the succession. At the base coarse continental deposits of the Lower Haima Group rest unconformably on Precambrian-Lower Cambrian Huqf Group sediments (mainly carbonates and evaporites). The overlying Upper Haima Group comprises from base to top the aeolian dominated Amin Formation, the non-marine (coastal plain) to shallow marine (intertidal-subtidal) sediments of the Andam Formation, the non-marine to marginally marine Ghudun Formation, and the complex cyclical deep to shallow water deposits of the Safiq Formation. Correlation of the Haima Group of Oman with the Lower Palaeozoic of the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa and Iran allows the evolution of the Gondwanan margin to be modelled. A widespread Lower Cambrian sequence of coarse alluvium, resting on peneplained Upper Precambrian-Infracambrian Huqf Group strata, represents the final stage of uplift and basin fill associated with the Late Proterozoic suturing of Arabia and adjacent plates which resulted in the formation of the Gondwanan continent. The overlying thick sequence of continental (fluvial and aeolian) sediments was deposited in a series of stable intracratonic basins across the Gondwanan landmass. In the Mid- and Late Cambrian an overall sea-level rise led to the repeated development of shallow marine shelf carbonates across the margin. The subsequent replacement of this marginal carbonate sequence with a thick marginal to non-marine, sand dominated sequence may reflect the interplay of several events: the drift of Gondwana towards more southerly latitudes, a phase of strong tectonic rejuvenation during the latest Cambrian-Early Ordovician, and/or a eustatic fall in sea-level. Organic-rich marine mudrocks were deposited over much of the Gondwanan platform during a series of marked eustatic sea-level rises during the Mid-Late Ordovician and Early Silurian. In Oman no evidence has yet been found for the significant Late Ordovician glacial event recorded from North Africa and Saudi Arabia.},

abstract = {Palaeomagnetic and faunal data have been re-evaluated on a global basis for the period from 400 Ma (early mid-Devonian) to 250 Ma (latest Permian). The boundaries of the major terranes are considered and defined. Six new palaeogeographical maps at 30 Ma intervals, which ensure kinematic continuity, are presented for this period. The palaeomagnetic data are very useful for positioning terranes for the present-day North Atlantic area, of variable value for China and Tarim, and for much of the large superterrane of Gondwana (being notably poor during the Early Devonian and the Early Carboniferous), and are sparse or non-existent for much of the rest of Asia. The relative positions of Laurussia and Gondwana at the end of the Palaeozoic when they united to form Pangaea are discussed, and it is concluded that the most convincing reconstruction (Pangaea A) is obtained by assuming an octupole contribution of 10-15% in combination with the main dipole of the Earth's magnetic field. As well as faunal and palaeomagnetic data, the disposition of the major sediment types, including coal deposits, evaporites and glacial deposits, has also been considered, especially in the late Carboniferous and Permian.},

abstract = {Eutrophication is one of the most severe and widespread forms of disturbance affecting coastal marine systems. Whilst there are general models of effects on benthos, such as the Pearson-Rosenberg (P-R) model, the models are descriptive rather than predictive. Here we first review the process of increased organic matter production and the ensuing sedimentation to the seafloor. It is shown that there is no simple relationship between nutrient inputs and the vertical flux of particulate organic matter (POM). In particular, episodic hydrographic events are thought to be the key factor leading to high rates of sedimentation and accompanying hypoxia. We extend an earlier review of effects of hypoxia to include organisms living in the water column. In general, fishes are more sensitive to hypoxia than crustaceans and echinoderms, which in turn are more sensitive than annelids, whilst molluscs are the least sensitive. Growth is affected at oxygen concentrations between 6.0 and 4.5 mg O2 l-1, other aspects of metabolism are affected at between 4 and 2 mg O2 l-1 and mortality occurs where concentrations are below 2.0 to 0.5 mg O2 l-1. Field studies, however, show that complex behavioural changes also occur as hypoxia increases, and these are described herein. The areas where hypoxia occurs are frequently areas that are stagnant or with poor water exchange. Thus again, hydrographic factors are key processes determining whether or not hypoxia and eutrophication occur. Tolerance to ammonia and hydrogen sulphide is also reviewed, as these substances are found at near zero concentrations of oxygen and are highly toxic to most organisms. However, the effects of interactions between oxygen, ammonia and hydrogen sulphide only occur below oxygen concentrations of ca. 0.5 mg O2 l-1, since only below this concentration are hydrogen sulphide and oxygen released into the water. Models of eutrophication and the generation of hypoxia are discussed, and in particular the P-R model is analysed. Although agreement with the model is widely reported the actual predictions of the model have rarely been tested. Our review suggests that the major effects on benthic fauna result from hypoxia rather than organic enrichment per se and suggests that the P-R model is descriptive rather than predictive. Finally, a managerial tool is proposed, based on the stages of effects of hypoxia and organic enrichment suggested by the P-R model and on an earlier study. The proposed strategy involves rapid assessment tools and indicates where more detailed surveys are needed. Managers are advised that remedial action will not produce rapid results and that recovery from eutrophication will probably take decades. Thus it is essential to detect potential hypoxia and eutrophication effects at early stages of development.},

abstract = {Recent revisions to the biostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic assignment of strata from the type area of the Niagaran Provincial Series (a regional chronostratigraphic unit) have demonstrated the need to revise the chronostratigraphic correlation of the Silurian System of North America. Recently, the working group to restudy the base of the Wenlock Series has developed an extremely high-resolution global chronostratigraphy for the Telychian and Sheinwoodian stages by integrating graptolite and conodont biostratigraphy with carbonate carbon isotope ($\delta$13Ccarb) chemostratigraphy. This improved global chronostratigraphy has required such significant chronostratigraphic revisions to the North American succession that much of the Silurian System in North America is currently in a state of flux and needs further refinement. This report serves as an update of the progress on recalibrating the global chronostratigraphic correlation of North American Provincial Series and Stage boundaries in their type area. The revised North American classification is correlated with global series and stages as well as regional classifications used in the United Kingdom, the East Baltic, Australia, China, the Barrandian, and Altaj.

abstract = {Carbonate platforms changed substantially in spatial extent, geometry, composition and palaeogeographical distribution through the Phanerozoic. Although reef construction and carbonate platform development are intimately linked today, this was not the case for most of the Phanerozoic. Carbonate production by non-enzymatic precipitation and non-reefal organisms is mostly responsible for this decoupling. Non-reefal carbonate production was especially prolific during times of depressed reef growth, balancing losses in reef carbonate production. Palaeogeographical distribution and spatial extent of Phanerozoic carbonate platforms exhibit trends related to continental drift, evolutionary patterns within carbonate platform biotas, climatic change and, possibly, variations in ocean chemistry. Continental drift moved large Palaeozoic tropical shelf areas into higher latitudes, thereby reducing the potential size of tropical platforms. However, the combined global size of carbonate platforms shows no significant decline through the Phanerozoic, suggesting that availability of tropical shelf areas was not a major control of platform area. This is explained by the limited platform coverage of low-latitude shelves (42% maximum) and occasional high-latitude excursions of platform carbonates. We speculate that reduced tropical shelf area in the icehouse tropics forced the migration of the many carbonate-secreting organisms into higher latitudes and, where terrigenous input was sufficiently low, extensive carbonate platform could develop.},

abstract = {Numerous fossil meteorites and high concentrations of sediment-dispersed extraterrestrial chromite (EC) grains with ordinary chondritic composition have previously been documented from 467±1.6Ma Middle Ordovician (Darriwilian) strata. These finds probably reflect a temporarily enhanced influx of L-chondritic matter, following the disruption of the L-chondrite parent body in the asteroid belt 470±6Ma. In this study, a Volkhovian-Kundan limestone/marl succession at Lynna River, northwestern Russia, has been searched for EC grains (>63$\mu$m). Eight samples, forming two separate sample sets, were collected. Five samples from strata around the Asaphus expansus-A. raniceps trilobite Zone boundary, in the lower-middle Kundan, yielded a total of 496 EC grains in 65.5kg of rock (average 7.6 EC grains kg -1, but up to 10.2 grains kg -1). These are extremely high concentrations, three orders of magnitude higher than "background" levels in similar condensed sediment from other periods. EC grains are typically about 50 times more abundant than terrestrial chrome spinel in the samples and about as common as terrestrial ilmenite. Three stratigraphically lower lying samples, close to the A. lepidurus-A. expansus trilobite Zone boundary, at the Volkhov-Kunda boundary, yielded only two EC grains in 38.2kg of rock (0.05 grains kg -1). The lack of commonly occurring EC grains in the lower interval probably reflects that these strata formed before the disruption of the L-chondrite parent body. The great similarity in EC chemical composition between this and other comparable studies indicates that all or most EC grains in these Russian mid-Ordovician strata share a common source--the L-chondrite parent body. {\textcopyright} The Meteoritical Society, 2012.},

abstract = {The algorithm developed by Vautard and Legras is applied to a series of 37 winters of 700 mb geopotential height observations, in order to identify quasi-stationary patterns occurring over the extratropical North Atlantic area. Weather regimes are obtained as solutions of a set of nine nonlinear statistical equations, giving the balance of the large-scale average tendency. Four regime patterns are found. The first one exhibits the typical European blocking dipole. The second one is an enhanced zonal flow. The third one consists of a positive anomaly over Greenland, and the last one is characterized by a ridge over the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The role played by the transient small scales in the maintenance of these four regimes is discussed. It is shown, in particular, that zonal flows are likely to become blocked flows, and that the Greenland Anticyclone regime (third regime) is likely to succeed blocking events. All statistics are tested against climatology. -from Author},

@article{Ridgwell2005,
abstract = {The Phanerozoic has seen fundamental changes in the global biogeochemical cycling of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), particularly the advent of biomineralization during the early Cambrian when the products of weathering could first be removed through metabolic expenditure, and the subsequent ecological success of planktic calcifiers during the Mesozoic which shifted the locus of deposition from the continental shelves to the deep open ocean. These biologically-driven CaCO3 depositional 'mode' changes along with geochemical and tectonic variations in boundary conditions such as sea-level and calcium ion concentrations all affected the carbonate chemistry of the ocean. I employ a model of atmosphere-ocean-sediment carbon cycling to explore the impact of these factors on the saturation state and carbonate chemistry of the global ocean during the Phanerozoic. The model results highlight that overall; the time evolution and regulation of Phanerozoic ocean chemistry are dominated by a Mid Mesozoic Revolution in the marine carbonate cycle. Prior to this transition, it was possible for the ocean to attain states of extreme saturation during the Permian and Triassic as well as during the late Precambrian. This is primarily a consequence of low sea-level in restricting the potential area for the deposition of shallow water carbonates, thus requiring a more saturated ocean and higher rate of precipitation per unit area in order to balance weathering input. This is consistent with the occurrence of mineralogically 'anomalous' carbonates during these periods but not commonly at other times. That the modern carbon cycle does not respond to similar tectonic forcings is due to the ecological success of calcifying planktic taxa during the Mesozoic, which in facilitating the creation of a responsive deep-sea carbonate sink enabled a much greater degree of regulation of saturation state than was previously possible. The model results also highlight the primary role of changes in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and of Ca 2+ in the ocean in determining surface pH. The uncertainty inherent in paleo CO2 estimates then translates into sufficient uncertainty in reconstructions of Phanerozoic temperature variability that one can only deduce from the carbonate $\delta$18O record that the Cretaceous was generally warmer and the Carboniferous colder than average. The substantially enhanced oceanic carbon inventory predicted for the Paleozoic suggests that previous calculations of methane hydrate release may have substantially underestimated the quantity of clathrate carbon required to explain observed carbon isotopic excursions. In both cases the importance of quantifying Phanerozoic marine chemistry is clear. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In North Africa, Late Ordovician glaciogenic reservoirs contain large volume of recoverable hydrocarbon reserves, but their heterogeneity and internal complexity means they are poorly understood. To improve this understanding, this paper presents the case study of the Murzuq Basin, SW Libya, and a synthesis of the stratigraphic architecture of Upper Ordovician glaciogenic reservoirs (the Mamuniyat Formation) within it. Particular attention is paid to regionally extensive stratigraphic boundaries and the geometry of sandstone units of potential reservoir quality. Four disconformity-bound units are recognised, the bounding surfaces of which are flat or of high relief. Unit 1 (the oldest) and Unit 3 are mud-dominated and tend towards non-reservoir. In contrast, Units 2 and 4 (the youngest) are sand-dominated, have poor to excellent reservoir quality but distinctly different sedimentological architectures across the basin. Unit 2 comprises transitions from glaciofluvial/intertidal sandstones to offshore turbidites and formed exclusively during glacial retreat. The occurrence of a significant palaeotopography affected sandbody geometry with glaciofluvial/intertidal deposits concentrating in the lee of these palaeohighs or infilling the bottom of tunnel valleys. Unit 4 is a compound stratigraphic unit recording the effects of glacial retreat and isostatic rebound. In deep marine settings, turbidite fans were deposited during retreat but in shallow water settings, structural reactivation and sediment reworking had a more profound effect on sedimentation. Sedimentological architectures are variable at this level and include prograding coarse clastic wedges (away from a palaeohigh) or the infill of half-graben basins during isostatic rebound. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Microporosity may account for a significant part of the total porosity of Cretaceous limestone reservoirs of the Middle East. In these microporous facies porosity is moderate to excellent (up to 35%) while permeability is poor to moderate (up to 190 mD). Micritic limestones also may form dense layers with very low porosity and permeability values.Micritic samples were collected from three fields of the Habshan and Mishrif Formations, to examine the spatial relationship with their porosity, permeability and pore throat radius distributions. Two key parameters of the micritic particles are studied using scanning electron microscopy: their morphology (shape and inter-crystal contacts), and their crystallometry.Results reveal that micrite matrixes can be subdivided into three petrophysical classes. Class C (strictly microporous limestones with coarse punctic-to-partially coalescent micrites) is made up of coarse (>2 $\mu$m) polyhedral to rounded micritic crystals, it has good to excellent porosity (8-28%), poor to moderate permeability (0.2-190 mD) and a mean pore threshold radius of more than 0.5 $\mu$m. The class C is usually observed in rudist shoal facies where relatively high hydrodynamic energy disfavoured deposition of the finer micritic crystals. It also developed within meteoric leaching intervals below exposure surfaces. Class F (strictly microporous limestones with fine punctic-to-partially coalescent micrites) is composed of fine (<2 $\mu$m) polyhedral to rounded micrites with poor to excellent porosity (3-35%), but permeability values of less than 10 mD and a mean pore threshold radius of less than 0.5 $\mu$m. It is mostly observed in sediments deposited in a low energy muddy inner platform setting. Class D (strictly microporous mud-dominated facies with compact anhedral to fused dense micrites) comprises subhedral to anhedral crystals with sutured contacts forming a dense matrix. It has very low porosity and permeability. Class D is only found in low energy muddy inner platform facies and forms inter-reservoir or caps rock layers in close association with stylolites and clay contents that usually exceed 10%. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Glacial episodes have been linked to Ordovician-Silurian extinction events, but cooling itself may not be solely responsible for these extinctions. Teratological (malformed) assemblages of fossil plankton that correlate precisely with the extinction events can help identify alternate drivers of extinction. Here we show that metal poisoning may have caused these aberrant morphologies during a late Silurian (Pridoli) event. Malformations coincide with a dramatic increase of metals (Fe, Mo, Pb, Mn and As) in the fossils and their host rocks. Metallic toxins are known to cause a teratological response in modern organisms, which is now routinely used as a proxy to assess oceanic metal contamination. Similarly, our study identifies metal-induced teratology as a deep-time, palaeobiological monitor of palaeo-ocean chemistry. The redox-sensitive character of enriched metals supports emerging 'oceanic anoxic event' models. Our data suggest that spreading anoxia and redox cycling of harmful metals was a contributing kill mechanism during these devastating Ordovician-Silurian palaeobiological events.},

Here, to assess the role of major continental configuration changes occurring during the Late Cretaceous on oceanic circulation modes, which in turn influence the oxygenation level of the deep ocean, we use a coupled ocean atmosphere climate model. We simulate ocean dynamics during two different time slices and compare these with existing neodymium isotope data ($\epsilon$Nd). Although deep-water production in the North Pacific is continuous, the simulations at 94 and 71Ma show a shift in southern deep-water production sites from South Pacific to South Atlantic and Indian Ocean locations. Our modelling results support the hypothesis that an intensification of southern Atlantic deep-water production and a reversal of deep-water fluxes through the Caribbean Seaway were the main causes of the decrease in $\epsilon$Nd values recorded in the Atlantic and Indian deep waters during the Late Cretaceous.},

During the same period, at least two phases of abrupt global sea-level rise - meltwater pulses - took place. Although the timing and magnitude of these events have become better constrained, a causal link between ocean stratification, the meltwater pulses and accelerated ice loss from Antarctica has not been proven. Here we simulate Antarctic ice sheet evolution over the last 25-kyr using a data-constrained ice-sheet model forced by changes in Southern Ocean temperature from an Earth system model. Results reveal several episodes of accelerated ice-sheet recession, the largest being coincident with meltwater pulse 1A. This resulted from reduced Southern Ocean overturning following Heinrich Event 1, when warmer subsurface water thermally eroded grounded marine-based ice and instigated a positive feedback that further accelerated ice-sheet retreat.},

Here we present new molybdenum isotope data, which demonstrate that the areal extent of oxygenated bottom waters increased in step with the early Cambrian bioradiation of animals and eukaryotic phytoplankton. Modern-like oxygen levels characterized the ocean at ∼521 Ma for the first time in Earth history. This marks the first establishment of a key environmental factor in modern-like ecosystems, where animals benefit from, and also contribute to, the 'homeostasis' of marine redox conditions.},

abstract = {Land, ocean, and atmospheric models are often implemented on different spherical grids. As a conseqence coupling these model components requires state variables and fluxes to be regridded. For some variables, such as fluxes, it is paramount that the regridding algorithm is conservative (so that energy and water budget balances are maintained) and monotone (to prevent unphysical values). For global applications the cubed-sphere grids are gaining popularity in the atmospheric community whereas, for example, the land modeling groups are mostly using the regular latitude-longitude grid. Most existing regridding schemes fail to take advantage of geometrical symmetries between these grids and hence accuracy of the calculations can be lost. Hence, a new Geometrically Exact Conservative Remapping (GECoRe) scheme with a monotone option is proposed for remapping between regular latitude-longitude and gnomonic cubed-sphere grids. GECoRe is compared with existing remapping schemes published in the meteorological literature. It is concluded here that the geometrically exact scheme significantly improves the accuracy of the resulting remapping in idealized test cases. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The evolution of Earth's climate on geological timescales is largely driven by variations in the magnitude of total solar irradiance (TSI) and changes in the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere. Here we show that the slow ∼50 Wm-2 increase in TSI over the last ∼420 million years (an increase of ∼9 Wm-2 of radiative forcing) was almost completely negated by a long-term decline in atmospheric CO2. This was likely due to the silicate weathering-negative feedback and the expansion of land plants that together ensured Earth's long-term habitability. Humanity's fossil-fuel use, if unabated, risks taking us, by the middle of the twenty-first century, to values of CO2 not seen since the early Eocene (50 million years ago). If CO2 continues to rise further into the twenty-third century, then the associated large increase in radiative forcing, and how the Earth system would respond, would likely be without geological precedent in the last half a billion years.},

Leading hypotheses invoke a release of deep-ocean carbon through enhanced convection in the Southern Ocean (SO) and concomitant decreased efficiency of the global soft-tissue pump (STP). However, the temporal evolution of both the STP and the carbonate counter pump (CCP) remains unclear, thus preventing the evaluation of their contributions to the pCO2 rise. Here we present sedimentary coccolith records combined with export production reconstructions from the Subantarctic Pacific to document the leverage the SO biological carbon pump (BCP) has imposed on deglacial pCO2. Our data suggest a weakening of BCP during the phases of carbon outgassing, due in part to an increased CCP along with higher surface ocean fertility and elevated [CO2aq]. We propose that reduced BCP efficiency combined with enhanced SO ventilation played a major role in propelling the Earth out of the last ice age.},

Average low-mid-latitude BSi burial flux in the superocean Panthalassa is ∼90% of that of the modern global ocean and relative amplitude varied by ∼20-50% over the 100 kyr to 30 Myr orbital cycles during the early Mesozoic. We hypothesize that BSi in chert was a major sink for oceanic dissolved silica (DSi), with fluctuations proportional to DSi input from chemical weathering on timescales longer than the residence time of DSi (<∼100 Kyr). Chemical weathering rates estimated by the GEOCARBSULFvolc model support these hypotheses, excluding the volcanism-driven oceanic anoxic events of the Early-Middle Triassic and Toarcian that exceed model limits. We propose that the Mega monsoon of the supercontinent Pangea nonlinearly amplified the orbitally paced chemical weathering that drove BSi burial during the early Mesozoic greenhouse world.},

Here we report a zircon U-Pb date of 467.50±0.28 Ma from a distinct bed within the meteorite-bearing interval of southern Sweden that, combined with published cosmic-ray exposure ages of co-occurring meteoritic material, provides a precise age for the L chondrite breakup at 468.0±0.3 Ma. The new zircon date requires significant revision of the Ordovician timescale that has implications for the understanding of the astrogeobiologic development during this period.

Environmental change across the extinction severely affected Devonian reef-builders, besides many other forms of marine life. Yet, cause-and-effect chains leading to the extinction remain poorly constrained as Late Devonian stratigraphy is poorly resolved, compared to younger cataclysmic intervals. In this study we present a global orbitally calibrated chronology across this momentous interval, applying cyclostratigraphic techniques. Our timescale stipulates that 600 kyr separate the lower and upper Kellwasser positive $\delta$ 13 C excursions. The latter excursion is paced by obliquity and is therein similar to Mesozoic intervals of environmental upheaval, like the Cretaceous Ocean-Anoxic-Event-2 (OAE-2). This obliquity signature implies coincidence with a minimum of the 2.4 Myr eccentricity cycle, during which obliquity prevails over precession, and highlights the decisive role of astronomically forced "Milankovitch" climate change in timing and pacing the Late Devonian mass extinction.},

However, there are few observations and there has been little attempt to understand the mechanisms that would lead to such a shape for planktonic organisms. Here we use a marine ecosystem model together with the community assembly theory to explain the shape of the unimodal PDR we obtain at the global scale. The positive slope from low to intermediate productivity is due to grazer control with selective feeding, which leads to the predator-mediated coexistence of prey. The negative slope at high productivity is due to seasonal blooms of opportunist species that occur before they are regulated by grazers. The negative side is only unveiled when the temporal scale of the observation captures the transient dynamics, which are especially relevant at highly seasonal latitudes. Thus selective predation explains the positive side while transient competitive exclusion explains the negative side of the unimodal PDR curve. The phytoplankton community composition of the positive and negative sides is mostly dominated by slow-growing nutrient specialists and fast-growing nutrient opportunist species, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Numerical models predict that increased organic carbon burial should drive a rise in atmospheric oxygen (pO 2) leading to termination of an OAE after ∼1 Myr. Wildfire is highly responsive to changes in pO 2 implying that fire-activity should vary across OAEs. Here we test this hypothesis by tracing variations in the abundance of fossil charcoal across the T-OAE. We report a sustained ∼800 kyr enhancement of fire-activity beginning ∼1 Myr after the onset of the T-OAE and peaking during its termination. This major enhancement of fire occurred across the timescale of predicted pO 2 variations, and we argue this was primarily driven by increased pO 2. Our study provides the first fossil-based evidence suggesting that fire-feedbacks to rising pO 2 may have aided in terminating the T-OAE.},

The rise of vascular plants during the Silurian and Devonian periods about 400 Myr ago brought about an increase in soil microbial activity and thus in soil CO2 generation, and it has therefore been widely believed that, as a result of these changes, soil CO2 replaced atmospheric CO2 as the primary agent of chemical weathering 3-6. Here we show that the aerated region above the water table (the vadose zone) exerts a strong influence on the CO2 concentration to which runoff is exposed as it percolates beneath the soil, and we argue that this could have been the case before the Silurian. We present calculations which show that, for present-day atmospheric CO2 concentrations, a low level of microbial respiration may be sufficient to support appreciable CO 2 concentrations in the vadose zone because of the slow rate of CO2 loss to the surface. Despite the small amount of microbial respiration in pre-Silurian soils, CO2 concentrations in subsoil vadose zones might therefore have been sufficient to account for the apparent constancy of chemical weathering since the mid-Proterozoic7, obviating the need to invoke high levels of atmospheric CO2 to explain the weathering record. {\textcopyright} 1993 Nature Publishing Group.},

This is in contrast with the extreme stability of the Holocene, suggesting that recent climate stability may be the exception rather than the rule. The last interglacial seems to have lasted longer than is implied by the deep-sea SPECMAP record4, in agreement with other land-based observations 5,6.

Cerling3 used carbon isotope ratios in soil carbonate minerals to constrain atmospheric PCo2m portions of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras.

Here we present data for goethites from an ironstone in the Upper Ordovician Neda Formation (Wisconsin, USA)8, which suggest that 440 Myr ago atmospheric PCo2 was ∼ 16 times higher than today. However, this enhanced level of atmospheric CO2 does not seem to have been accompanied by unusually warm temperatures in the tropics, and in fact may have been contemporaneous with high-latitude continental glaciation on Gondwanaland9,10. {\textcopyright} 1992 Nature Publishing Group.},

Some researchers surmise that the whole-ocean reservoir of algal nutrients was larger during glacial times, strengthening the biological pump at low latitudes, where these nutrients are currently limiting. Others propose that the biological pump was more efficient during glacial times because of more complete utilization of nutrients at high latitudes, where much of the nutrient supply currently goes unused. We present a version of the latter hypothesis that focuses on the open ocean surrounding Antarctica, involving both the biology and physics of that region.},

Suppressing Ca2+ transients by photorelease of a Ca2+ chelator accelerates axon extension, whereas mimicking transients with photorelease of Ca2+ slows otherwise rapid axonal growth. The frequency of Ca2+ transients is cell-type specific and depends on the position of growth cones along their pathway. Furthermore, growth-cone stalling and axon retraction, which are two important aspects of pathfinding8, 9, 10, are associated with high frequencies of Ca2+ transients.

The chemistry of Neogene sediments from the main locus of sedimentary deposition for Himalayan detritus, the Bengal Fan, can be used to estimate the sinks of CO2 from silicate weathering and from the weathering and burial of organic carbon resulting from Himalayan uplift. Here we show that Neogene CO2 consumption from the net burial of organic carbon during Himalayan sediment deposition was 2-3 times that resulting from the weathering of Himalayan silicates. Thus the dominant effect of Neogene Himalayan erosion on the carbon cycle is an increase in the amount of organic carbon in the sedimentary reservoir, not an increase in silicate weathering fluxes.},

abstract = {Coccolithophores are marine algae that use carbon for calcification and photosynthesis. The long-term adaptation of these and other marine algae to decreasing carbon dioxide levels during the Cenozoic era has resulted in modern algae capable of actively enhancing carbon dioxide at the site of photosynthesis. This enhancement occurs through the transport of dissolved bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) and with the help of enzymes whose expression can be modulated by variable aqueous carbon dioxide concentration, [CO 2 ], in laboratory cultures. Coccolithophores preserve the geological history of this adaptation because the stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of their calcite plates (coccoliths), which are preserved in the fossil record, are sensitive to active carbon uptake and transport by the cell. Here we use a model of cellular carbon fluxes and show that at low [CO 2 ] the increased demand for HCO 3 - at the site of photosynthesis results in a diminished allocation of HCO 3 - to calcification, which is most pronounced in larger cells. This results in a large divergence between the carbon isotopic compositions of small versus large coccoliths only at low [CO 2 ]. Our evaluation of the oxygen and carbon isotope record of size-separated fossil coccoliths reveals that this isotopic divergence first arose during the late Miocene to the earliest Pliocene epoch (about 7-5 million years ago). We interpret this to be a threshold response of the cells' carbon acquisition strategies to decreasing [CO 2 ]. The documented coccolithophore response is synchronous with a global shift in terrestrial vegetation distribution between 8 and 5 Myr ago, which has been interpreted by some studies as a floral response to decreasing partial pressures of carbon dioxide () in the atmosphere. We infer a global decrease in carbon dioxide levels for this time interval that has not yet been identified in the sparse proxy record but is synchronous with global cooling and progressive glaciations.},

abstract = {During glacial periods of the Late Pleistocene, an abundance of proxy data demonstrates the existence of large and repeated millennial-scale warming episodes, known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events1. This ubiquitous feature of rapid glacial climate change can be extended back as far as 800,000 years before present (bp) in the ice core record2, and has drawn broad attention within the science and policy-making communities alike 3. Many studies have been dedicated to investigating the underlying causes of these changes, but no coherent mechanism has yet been identified 3-15. Here we show, by using a comprehensive fully coupled model 16, that gradual changes in the height of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (NHISs) can alter the coupled atmosphere-ocean system and cause rapid glacial climate shifts closely resembling DO events. The simulated global climate responses - including abrupt warming in the North Atlantic, a northward shift of the tropical rainbelts, and Southern Hemisphere cooling related to the bipolar seesaw - are generally consistent with empirical evidence 1,3,17. As a result of the coexistence of two glacial ocean circulation states at intermediate heights of the ice sheets, minor changes in the height of the NHISs and the amount of atmospheric CO2 can trigger the rapid climate transitions via a local positive atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice feedback in the North Atlantic. Our results, although based on a single model, thus provide a coherent concept for understanding the recorded millennial-scale variability and abrupt climate changes in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system, as well as their linkages to the volume of the intermediate ice sheets during glacials. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Ediacaran (635-542million years ago) fossils have been regarded as early animal ancestors of the Cambrian evolutionary explosion of marine invertebrate phyla, as giant marine protists and as lichenized fungi. Recent documentation of palaeosols in the Ediacara Member of the Rawnsley Quartzite of South Australia confirms past interpretations of lagoonal-aeolian deposition based on synsedimentary ferruginization and loessic texture. Further evidence for palaeosols comes from non-marine facies, dilation cracks, soil nodules, sand crystals, stable isotopic data and mass balance geochemistry. Here I show that the uppermost surfaces of the palaeosols have a variety of fossils in growth position, including Charniodiscus, Dickinsonia, Hallidaya, Parvancorina, Phyllozoon, Praecambridium, Rugoconites, Tribrachidium and 'old-elephant skin' (ichnogenus Rivularites). These fossils were preserved as ferruginous impressions, like plant fossils, and biological soil crusts of Phanerozoic eon sandy palaeosols. Sand crystals after gypsum and nodules of carbonate are shallow within the palaeosols, even after correcting for burial compaction. Periglacial involutions and modest geochemical differentiation of the palaeosols are evidence of a dry, cold temperate Ediacaran palaeoclimate in South Australia. This new interpretation of some Ediacaran fossils as large sessile organisms of cool, dry soils, is compatible with observations that Ediacaran fossils were similar in appearance and preservation to lichens and other microbial colonies of biological soil crusts, rather than marine animals, or protists. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Modelling studies have described likely physical mechanisms for these events, but the quantitative characteristics of Heinrich events are less well known. Here we use a climate model of intermediate complexity that explicitly calculates the distribution of oxygen isotopes in the oceans to stimulate Heinrich event 4 at about 40,000 yr ago. We compare an ensemble of scenarios for this Heinrich event with oxygen isotope data measured in foraminiferal calcite of a comprehensive set of sediment cores. From this comparison, we obtain a duration of 250 ± 150 yr and an ice release of 2 ± 1 m sea-level equipment for Heinrich event 4, significantly reducing the uncertainties in both values compared to earlier estimates of up to 2,000 yr and 15 m of sea-level equivalent ice release, respectively. Our results indicate that the consequences of Heinrich events may have been less severe than previosly assumed, at least with respect to Greenland climate and sea level.},

abstract = {The long-standing view of Earth's Cenozoic glacial history calls for the first continental-scale glaciation of Antarctica in the earliest Oligocene epoch (∼33.6 million years ago), followed by the onset of northern-hemispheric glacial cycles in the late Pliocene epoch, about 31 million years later. The pivotal early Oligocene event is characterized by a rapid shift of 1.5 parts per thousand in deep-sea benthic oxygen-isotope values (Oi-1) within a few hundred thousand years, reflecting a combination of terrestrial ice growth and deep-sea cooling. The apparent absence of contemporaneous cooling in deep-sea Mg/Ca records, however, has been argued to reflect the growth of more ice than can be accommodated on Antarctica; this, combined with new evidence of continental cooling and ice-rafted debris in the Northern Hemisphere during this period, raises the possibility that Oi-1 represents a precursory bipolar glaciation. Here we test this hypothesis using an isotope-capable global climate/ice-sheet model that accommodates both the long-term decline of Cenozoic atmospheric CO2 levels and the effects of orbital forcing. We show that the CO2 threshold below which glaciation occurs in the Northern Hemisphere (∼280 p.p.m.v.) is much lower than that for Antarctica (∼750 p.p.m.v.). Therefore, the growth of ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere immediately following Antarctic glaciation would have required rapid CO 2 drawdown within the Oi-1 timeframe, to levels lower than those estimated by geochemical proxies and carbon-cycle models. Instead of bipolar glaciation, we find that Oi-1 is best explained by Antarctic glaciation alone, combined with deep-sea cooling of up to 4°C and Antarctic ice that is less isotopically depleted (-30 to -35‰) than previously suggested. Proxy CO2 estimates remain above our model's northern-hemispheric glaciation threshold of ∼280 p.p.m.v. until ∼25 Myr ago, but have been near or below that level ever since. This implies that episodic northern-hemispheric ice sheets have been possible some 20 million years earlier than currently assumed (although still much later than Oi-1) and could explain some of the variability in Miocene sea-level records. {\textcopyright}2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Long-term carbon and sulfur cycle models have helped shape our understanding of the Phanerozoic history of atmospheric CO2 and O2, but error analyses have been largely limited to testing only a subset of input parameters singly. As a result, the full ranges of probable CO2 and O2 are not quantitatively known. Here we investigate how variation in all 68 input parameters of the GEOCARBSULF model, both singly and in combination, affect estimated CO2 and O2. We improve formulations for land area, runoff, and continental temperature, the latter of which now excludes land area not experiencing chemical weathering. We find our resampled model CO2 and O2 estimates are well bounded and provide high confidence for a "double-hump" in CO2 during the Phanerozoic, with high values during the early Paleozoic and Mesozoic, and low values during the late Paleozoic and late Mesozoic-to-Cenozoic. Our analyses also support a distinct atmospheric O2 peak during the late Paleozoic (>30%) followed by low values near the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (∼10%). Most of the spread in CO2 is contributed by three factors: climate sensitivity to CO2-doubling and the plant-assisted chemical weathering factors LIFE and GYM. CO2 estimates during the Paleozoic to early Mesozoic are highly concordant with independent records from proxies, but are offset to lower values during the globally warm late Mesozoic to early Cenozoic. The model-proxy mismatch for the late Mesozoic can be eliminated with a change in GYM within its plausible range, but no change within plausible ranges can resolve the early Cenozoic mismatch. Either the true value for one or more input parameters during this interval is outside our sampled range, or the model is missing one or more key processes.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT. We present a new model of biogeochemical cycling over Phanerozoic time. This work couples a feedback-based model of atmospheric O2 and ocean nutrients (Lenton and Watson, 2000a, 2000b) with a geochemical carbon cycle model (Berner, 1991, 1994), a simple sulfur cycle, and additional components. The resulting COPSE model (Carbon-Oxygen-Phosphorus-Sulfur-Evolution) represents the coevolution of biotic and abiotic components of the Earth system, in that it couples interactive and evolving terrestrial and marine biota to geochemical and tectonic processes. The model is forced with geological and evolutionary forcings and timedependent solar insolation. The baseline model succeeds in giving simultaneous predictions of atmospheric O2, CO2, global temperature, ocean composition, 13C and 34S that are in reasonable agreement with available data and suggested constraints. The behavior of the coupled model is qualitatively different to single cycle models. While atmospheric pCO2 (CO2 partial pressure) predictions are mostly determined by the model forcings and the response of silicate weathering rate to pCO2 and temperature, multiple negative feedback processes and coupling of the C, O, P and S cycles are necessary for regulating pO2 while allowing 13C changes of sufficient amplitude to match the record. The results support a pO2 dependency of oxidative weathering of reduced carbon and sulfur, which raises early Paleozoic pO2 above the estimated requirement of Cambrian fauna and prevents unrealistically large 34S variation. They do not support a strong anoxia dependency of the C:P burial ratio of marine organic matter (Van Cappellen and Ingall, 1994, 1996) because this dependency raises early Paleozoic 13C and organic carbon burial rates too high. The dependency of terrestrial primary productivity on pO2 also contributes to oxygen regulation. An intermediate strength oxygen fire feedback on terrestrial biomass, which gives a pO2 upper limit of 1.6PAL (present atmospheric level) or 30 volume percent, provides the best combined pO2 and 13C predictions. Sulfur cycle coupling contributes critically to lowering the Permo-Carboniferous pCO2 and temperature minimum. The results support an inverse dependency of pyrite sulfur burial on pO2 (for example, Berner and Canfield, 1989), which contributes to the shuttling of oxygen back and forth between carbonate carbon and gypsum sulfur. A pO2 dependency of photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation (Berner and others, 2000; Beerling and others, 2002) is important for producing sufficient magnitude of 13C variation. However, our results do not support an oxygen dependency of sulfur isotope fractionation in pyrite formation (Berner and others, 2000) because it generates unrealistically small variations in 34S. In the Early Paleozoic, COPSE predicts pO20.2–0.6PAL and pCO2>10PAL, with high oceanic [PO4 3-] and low [SO4 ]. Land plant evolution caused a ‘phase change' in the Earth system by increasing weathering rates and shifting some organic burial to land. This change resulted in a major drop in pCO2 to 3 to 4PAL and a rise in pO2 to 1.5PAL in the Permo-Carboniferous, with temperatures below present, ocean variables nearer present concentrations, and PO4:NO3 regulated closer to Redfield ratio. A second O2 peak of similar or slightly greater magnitude appears in the mid- Cretaceous, before a descent towards PAL. Mesozoic CO2 is in the range 3 to 7PAL, descending toward PAL in the Cretaceous and Cenozoic.},

abstract = {It is likely that unambiguous habitable zone terrestrial planets of unknown water content will soon be discovered. Water content helps determine surface land fraction, which influences planetary weathering behavior. This is important because the silicate-weathering feedback determines the width of the habitable zone in space and time. Here a low-order model of weathering and climate, useful for gaining qualitative understanding, is developed to examine climate evolution for planets of various land-ocean fractions. It is pointed out that, if seafloor weathering does not depend directly on surface temperature, there can be no weathering-climate feedback on a waterworld. This would dramatically narrow the habitable zone of a waterworld. Results from our model indicate that weathering behavior does not depend strongly on land fraction for partially ocean-covered planets. This is powerful because it suggests that previous habitable zone theory is robust to changes in land fraction, as long as there is some land. Finally, a mechanism is proposed for a waterworld to prevent complete water loss during a moist greenhouse through rapid weathering of exposed continents. This process is named a "waterworld self-arrest," and it implies that waterworlds can go through a moist greenhouse stage and end up as planets like Earth with partial ocean coverage. This work stresses the importance of surface and geologic effects, in addition to the usual incident stellar flux, for habitability. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {Euxinic ocean conditions accompanied significant events in Earth history, including several Phanerozoic biotic crises. By critically examining modern and ancient euxinic environments and the range of hypotheses for these sulfidic episodes, we elucidate the primary factors that influenced the generation of euxinia. We conclude that periods of global warmth promoted anoxia because of reduced solubility of oxygen, not because of ocean stagnation. Anoxia led to phosphate release from sediments, and continental configurations with expansive nutrient-trapping regions focused nutrient recycling and increased regional nutrient buildup. This great nutrient supply would have fueled high biological productivity and oxygen demand, enhancing oxygen depletion and sulfide buildup via sulfate reduction. As long as warm conditions prevailed, these positive feedbacks sustained euxinic conditions. In rare, extreme cases, euxinia led to biotic crises, a hypothesis best supported by evidence from the end-Permian mass extinction.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that chemical weathering of Ca-silicate rocks could potentially control long-term climate change by providing feedback interaction with atmospheric CO2 drawdown by means of precipitation of carbonate, and that in contrast weathering of carbonate rocks has not an equivalent impact because all of the CO2 consumed in the weathering process is returned to the atmosphere by the comparatively rapid precipitation of carbonates in the oceans. Here, it is shown that the rapid kinetics of carbonate dissolution and the importance of small amounts of carbonate minerals in controlling the dissolved inorganic C (DIC) of silicate watersheds, coupled with aquatic photosynthetic uptake of the weathering-related DIC and burial of some of the resulting organic C, suggest that the atmospheric CO2 sink from carbonate weathering may previously have been underestimated by a factor of about 3, amounting to 0.477Pg C/a. This indicates that the contribution of silicate weathering to the atmospheric CO2 sink may be only 6%, while the other 94% is by carbonate weathering. Therefore, the atmospheric CO2 sink by carbonate weathering might be significant in controlling both the short-term and long-term climate changes. This questions the traditional point of view that only chemical weathering of Ca-silicate rocks potentially controls long-term climate change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The geological record provides evidence for the periodic occurrence of water column anoxia and formation of organic-rich deposits in the North Atlantic Ocean during the mid-Cretaceous (hereafter called the proto-North Atlantic). Both changes in primary productivity and oceanic circulation likely played a role in the development of the low-oxygen conditions. Several studies suggest that an increased input of phosphorus from land initiated oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). Other proposed mechanisms invoke a vigorous upwelling system and an ocean circulation pattern that acted as a trap for nutrients from the Pacific Ocean. <br><br> Here, we use a detailed biogeochemical box model for the proto-North Atlantic to analyse under what conditions anoxia could have developed during OAE2 (94 Ma). The model explicitly describes the coupled water, carbon, oxygen and phosphorus cycles for the deep basin and continental shelves. In our simulations, we assume the vigorous water circulation from a recent regional ocean model study. Our model results for pre-OAE2 and OAE2 conditions are compared to sediment records of organic carbon and proxies for photic zone euxinia and bottom water redox conditions (e.g. isorenieratane, carbon/phosphorus ratios). Our results show that a strongly elevated input of phosphorus from rivers and the Pacific Ocean relative to pre-OAE2 conditions is a requirement for the widespread development of low oxygen in the proto-North Atlantic during OAE2. Moreover, anoxia in the proto-North Atlantic is shown to be greatly influenced by the oxygen concentration of Pacific bottom waters. In our model, primary productivity increased significantly upon the transition from pre-OAE2 to OAE2 conditions. Our model captures the regional trends in anoxia as deduced from observations, with euxinia spreading to the northern and eastern shelves but with the most intense euxinia occurring along the southern coast. However, anoxia in the central deep basin is difficult to achieve in the model. This suggests that the ocean circulation used in the model may be too vigorous and/or that anoxia in the proto-North Atlantic was less widespread than previously thought. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

abstract = {Calcification by coral reef communities is estimated to account for half of all carbonate produced in shallow water environments and more than 25% of the total carbonate buried in marine sediments globally. Production of calcium carbonate by coral reefs is therefore an important component of the global carbon cycle. It is also threatened by future global warming and other global change pressures. Numerical models of reefal carbonate production are essential for understanding how carbonate deposition responds to environmental conditions including future atmospheric CO2concentrations, but these models must first be evaluated in terms of their skill in recreating present day calcification rates. Here we evaluate four published model descriptions of reef carbonate production in terms of their predictive power, at both local and global scales, by comparing carbonate budget outputs with independent estimates. We also compile available global data on reef calcification to produce an observation-based dataset for the model evaluation. The four calcification models are based on functions sensitive to combinations of light availability, aragonite saturation ($\Omega$a) and temperature and were implemented within a specifically-developed global framework, the Global Reef Accretion Model (GRAM). None of the four models correlated with independent rate estimates of whole reef calcification. The temperature-only based approach was the only model output to significantly correlate with coral-calcification rate observations. The absence of any predictive power for whole reef systems, even when consistent at the scale of individual corals, points to the overriding importance of coral cover estimates in the calculations. Our work highlights the need for an ecosystem modeling approach, accounting for population dynamics in terms of mortality and recruitment and hence coral cover, in estimating global reef carbonate budgets. In addition, validation of reef carbonate budgets is severely hampered by limited and inconsistent methodology in reef-scale observations.},

abstract = {We describe the design and evaluation of a large ensemble of coupled climate-carbon cycle simulations with the Earth system model of intermediate complexity GENIE. This ensemble has been designed for application to a range of carbon cycle questions, including the causes of late-Quaternary fluctuations in atmospheric CO 2 . Here we evaluate the ensemble by applying it to a transient experiment over the recent industrial era (1858 to 2008 AD). We employ singular vector decomposition and principal component emulation to investigate the spatial modes of ensemble variability of oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) $\delta$ 13 C, considering both the spun-up pre-industrial state and the transient change. These analyses allow us to separate the natural (pre-industrial) and anthropogenic controls on the $\delta$ 13 C DIC distribution. We apply the same dimensionally-reduced emulation techniques to consider the drivers of the spatial uncertainty in anthropogenic DIC. We show that the sources of uncertainty related to the uptake of anthropogenic $\delta$ 13 C DIC and DIC are quite distinct. Uncertainty in anthropogenic $\delta$ 13 C uptake is controlled by air-sea gas exchange, which explains 63% of modelled variance. This mode of variability is largely absent from the ensemble variability in CO 2 uptake, which is rather driven by uncertainties in thermocline ventilation rates. Although the need to account for air-sea gas exchange is well known, these results suggest that, to leading order, uncertainties in the ocean uptake of anthropogenic 13 C and CO 2 are governed by very different processes. This illustrates the difficulties in reconstructing one from the other, and furthermore highlights the need for careful targeting of both $\delta$ 13 C DIC and DIC observations to better constrain the ocean sink of anthropogenic CO 2 . {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Terrestrial biosphere models typically abstract the immense diversity of vegetation forms and functioning into a relatively small set of predefined semi-empirical plant functional types (PFTs). There is growing evidence, however, from the field ecology community as well as from modelling studies that current PFT schemes may not adequately represent the observed variations in plant functional traits and their effect on ecosystem functioning. In this paper, we introduce the Jena Diversity-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (JeDi-DGVM) as a new approach to terrestrial biosphere modelling with a richer representation of functional diversity than traditional modelling approaches based on a small number of fixed PFTs. <br><br> JeDi-DGVM simulates the performance of a large number of randomly generated plant growth strategies, each defined by a set of 15 trait parameters which characterize various aspects of plant functioning including carbon allocation, ecophysiology and phenology. Each trait parameter is involved in one or more functional trade-offs. These trade-offs ultimately determine whether a strategy is able to survive under the climatic conditions in a given model grid cell and its performance relative to the other strategies. The biogeochemical fluxes and land surface properties of the individual strategies are aggregated to the grid-cell scale using a mass-based weighting scheme. <br><br> We evaluate the simulated global biogeochemical patterns against a variety of field and satellite-based observations following a protocol established by the Carbon-Land Model Intercomparison Project. The land surface fluxes and vegetation structural properties are reasonably well simulated by JeDi-DGVM, and compare favourably with other state-of-the-art global vegetation models. We also evaluate the simulated patterns of functional diversity and the sensitivity of the JeDi-DGVM modelling approach to the number of sampled strategies. Altogether, the results demonstrate the parsimonious and flexible nature of a functional trade-off approach to global vegetation modelling, i.e. it can provide more types of testable outputs than standard PFT-based approaches and with fewer inputs. <br><br> The approach implemented here in JeDi-DGVM sets the foundation for future applications that will explore the impacts of explicitly resolving diverse plant communities, allowing for a more flexible temporal and spatial representation of the structure and function of the terrestrial biosphere.</p>},

abstract = {We investigate the significance of in situ dissolution of calcium carbonate above its saturation horizons using observations from the open subpolar North Atlantic [sNA] and to a lesser extent a 3-D biogeochemical model. The sNA is particularly well suited for observation-based detections of in situ, i.e. shallow-depth CaCO3 dissolution [SDCCD] as it is a region of high CaCO3 production, deep CaCO3 saturation horizons, and precisely-defined pre-formed alkalinity. Based on the analysis of a comprehensive alkalinity data set we find that SDCCD does not appear to be a significant process in the open sNA. The results from the model support the observational findings by indicating that there is not a significant need of SDCCD to explain observed patterns of alkalinity in the North Atlantic. Instead our investigation points to the importance of mixing processes for the redistribution of alkalinity from dissolution of CaCO3 from below its saturation horizons. However, mixing has recently been neglected for a number of studies that called for SDCCD in the sNA and on global scale.},

abstract = {We have extended the 3-D ocean based "Grid EN-abled Integrated Earth system model" (GENIE-1) to help understand the role of ocean biogeochemistry and marine sediments in the long-term (∼100 to 100000 year) regulation of atmospheric CO2, and the importance of feedbacks between CO2 and climate. Here we describe the ocean carbon cycle, which in its first incarnation is based around a simple single nutrient (phosphate) control on biological productivity. The addition of calcium carbonate preservation in deep-sea sediments and its role in regulating atmospheric CO2 is presented elsewhere (Ridgwell and Hargreaves, 2007). We have calibrated the model parameters controlling ocean carbon cycling in GENIE-1 by assimilating 3-D observational datasets of phosphate and alkalinity using an ensemble Kalman filter method. The calibrated (mean) model predicts a global export production of particulate organic carbon (POC) of 8.9 PgC yr-1, and reproduces the main features of dissolved oxygen distributions in the ocean. For estimating biogenic calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) production, we have devised a parameterization in which the CaCO3POC export ratio is related directly to ambient saturation state. Calibrated global CaCO3 export production (1.2 PgC yr -1) is close to recent marine carbonate budget estimates. The GENIE-1 Earth system model is capable of simulating a wide variety of dissolved and isotopic species of relevance to the study of modern global biogeochemical cycles as well as past global environmental changes recorded in paleoceanographic proxies. Importantly, even with 12 active biogeochemical tracers in the ocean and including the calculation of feedbacks between atmospheric CO2 and climate, we achieve better than 1000 years per (2.4 GHz) CPU hour on a desktop PC. The GENIE-1 model thus provides a viable alternative to box and zonally-averaged models for studying global biogeochemical cycling over all but the very longest (> 1000000 year) time-scales.},

During the entire existence of the biosphere procaryotes are always present, 2 Gyr ago eucaryotic life first appears. The emergence of complex multicellular life is connected with an explosive increase in biomass and a strong decrease in Cambrian global surface temperature at about 0.54 Gyr ago. In the long-term future the three types of biosphere will die out in reverse sequence of their appearance. We show that there is no evidence for an implosion-like extinction in contrast to the Cambrian explosion. In dependence of their temperature tolerance complex multicellular life and eucaryotes become extinct in about 0.8-1.2 Gyr and 1.3-1.5 Gyr, respectively.

abstract = {Rocks of Late Ordovician to Silurian age are well exposed on the western rim of the Murzuq Basin (Ghat-Tikiumit area, Libya) where seismic-scale exposures allow spectacular insights into the growth and decay of the Late Ordovician (Hirnantian) ice sheet. The final deglaciation left a complex topography with a combination of subglacial morphologies and proglacial depositional systems. This paper documents the glacial and proglacial palaeo-topography that controls the accumulation of a postglacial transgressive depositional system and the Rhuddanian (Early Silurian) shales. The glacial relief directly contributed to an important hiatus, with the Rhuddanian deposits at the base of the remnant glacial troughs being 3Ma older than at the top of the topographic highs. The source-rock in the Murzuq Basin is of Early Rhuddanian age, so it is present only in the deepest part whereas geomorphic traps are formed within the highs of the relict postglacial topography. The transgressive system, recognised for its good reservoir potential, is considered to play a key-role in the petroleum system, linking the source rock deposited in the ancient topographic lows with the reservoir rocks in the topographic highs. This study aims to demonstrate the importance of palaeo-glaciological reconstructions for petroleum exploration of the Ordovician-Silurian in North Africa. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

Six transgressive-regressive (T-R), low-frequency (15-25 Ma) depositional sequences have been differentiated and correlated with both northern distal (Anti-Atlas, Morocco) and southern proximal (Ahnet, southern Algeria) areas. Sequence 1 ("Lower" Cambrian?) comprises fluvial deposits truncating volcanics and deformed Panafrican basement rocks. Marine strata appeared in Sequence 2 (lower and middle part of the "Middle" Cambrian) but fluvial conditions maintained to the South. Sequence 3 (upper "Middle" Cambrian) is erosionally truncated but further develops to the south, possibly comprising "Upper" Cambrian deposits. In Sequence 4 (Lower Ordovician), fluvial deposits are no longer present and inner-shelf siltstones reached southern Ougarta. Sequences 5 and 6, upper Lower-Middle Ordovician and Upper Ordovician, develop inner-shelf conditions throughout the study area at maximum flooding. Hirnantian glacial strata form a lowstand wedge in the upper part of the Sequence 6 regressive system tract. This succession designates a first-order transgression initiating in the Cambrian. It was temporarily perturbed just before its end by the Hirnantian glaciation. The related erosion led to a discontinuity, angular at basin scale, falsely suggesting a pre-glacial tectonic event. The post-glacial transgression, very fast relative to the Cambrian-Ordovician tempo, resulted in a drastic backstepping of the shorelines that shifted drastically to the south in the early Silurian. After deglaciation, the first-order inversion trend occurred between retrograding strata of the Cambrian-Ordovician succession and the prograding Siluro-Devonian wedge. This event marks in North Africa the maximum flooding of the Lower Palaeozoic megasequence.},

The present paper tests a hypothesis as to whether a difference of about 2%o in the magnitude of the $\delta$13Ccarb anomaly is caused by the different content of dolomite, which could be enriched in both13C and18O relative to coexisting calcite, as has been suggested by experimental data. The new data obtained reveal that the $\delta$18O composition of calcite and dolomite was probably controlled by the pore-fluid composition during limestone diagenesis and that both carbonates seem to be close to equilibrium in oxygen isotope composition. On the other hand, the $\delta$13C values of dolomite are similar to those of calcite, and thus the carbon isotope composition of both carbonates was probably determined by the precursor carbonate composition. Moreover, the values of $\delta$13Cdolomite/$\delta$13Ccalcite ratios as well as their variability suggest that both calcite and dolomite did not reach equilibrium in their carbon isotope composition. Whole-rock, mineralogical, and C and O isotope data clearly show that dolomite is not the cause for the differences in magnitudes of the$\delta$13C records observed between dolomite-bearing and dolomite-lacking shallow-water limestone successions. The question as to whether the observed differences in the $\delta$13C records of the studied sections across the Homerian carbon isotope excursion were controlled by the dependence of seawater composition on water depth and (or) proximity to shoreline or if the $\delta$13C values were later affected by secondary processes during limestone diagenesis is still unsolved.},

Based on an extensive compilation of published and unpublished data, we show that their accumulation rates in sediments increased from the Early Jurassic (1/4200Ma) to the Early Cretaceous (1/4120Ma), although these algae diversified up to the end of the Mesozoic (66&thinsp;Ma). After the middle Eocene (1/445Ma), a decoupling occurred between accumulation rates, diversity and coccolith size. The time series analyzed points toward a three-phase evolutionary dynamic. An invasion phase of the open-ocean realms was followed by a specialization phase occurring along with taxonomic diversification, ended by an establishment phase where a few small-sized species dominated. The current hegemony of calcareous nannoplankton in the world ocean results from a long-term and complex evolutionary history shaped by ecological interactions and abiotic forcing.},

abstract = {A total of 2128 calcitic and phosphatic shells, mainly brachiopods with some conodonts and belemnites, were measured for their $\delta$ 18 O, $\delta$ 13 C and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values. The dataset covers the Cambrian to Cretaceous time interval. Where possible, these samples were collected at high temporal resolution, up to 0.7 Ma (one biozone), from the stratotype sections of all continents but Antarctica and from many sedimentary basins. Paleogeographically, the samples are mostly from paleotropical domains. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), petrography, cathodoluminescence and trace element results of the studied calcitic shells and the conodont alteration index (CAI) data of the phosphatic shells are consistent with an excellent preservation of the ultrastructure of the analyzed material. These datasets are complemented by extensive literature compilations of Phanerozoic low-Mg calcitic, aragonitic and phosphatic isotope data for analogous skeletons. The oxygen isotope signal exhibits a long-term increase of $\delta$ 18 O from a mean value of about - 8‰ (PDB) in the Cambrian to a present mean value of about 0‰ (PDB). Superimposed on the general trend are shorter-term oscillations with their apexes coincident with cold episodes and glaciations. The carbon isotope signal shows a similar climb during the Paleozoic, an inflexion in the Permian, followed by an abrupt drop and subsequent fluctuations around the modern value. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios differ from the earlier published curves in their greater detail and in less dispersion of the data. The means of the observed isotope signals for 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, $\delta$ 18 O, $\delta$ 13 C and the less complete $\delta$ 34 S (sulfate) are strongly interrelated at any geologically reasonable (1 to 40 Ma) time resolution. All correlations are valid at the 95% level of confidence, with the most valid at the 99% level. Factor analysis indicates that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, $\delta$ 18 O, $\delta$ 13 C and $\delta$ 34 S isotope systems are driven by three factors. The first factor links oxygen and strontium isotopic evolution, the second 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and $\delta$ 34 S, and the third one the $\delta$ 13 C and $\delta$ 34 S. These three factors explain up to 79% of the total variance. We tentatively identify the first two factors as tectonic, and the third one as a (biologically mediated) redox linkage of the sulfur and carbon cycles. On geological timescales (≥ 1 Ma), we are therefore dealing with a unified exogenic (litho-, hydro-, atmo-, biosphere) system driven by tectonics via its control of (bio)geochemical cycles. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Because few microtextures are considered to represent a single geologic process it is necessary to analyze a large number of quartz sands and other mineralic grains with the objective of determining the frequency of occurrence of a range of microtextures within a distinct sample suite. Using percent frequency of occurrence of different microtextures from suites of fluvial, glaciofluvial and glacial sands from sites in Estonia and Latvia, we invoked statistical comparison of different sample suites using Euclidean distances. These provide a quantitative means of measuring the differences among different sediments and processes that formed them and also a quantification tool useful in assessing microtextures as a recorder of sedimentary environments.},

abstract = {This study attempts to characterise the chemical weathering of basalts and to quantify the flux of carbon transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean during this major process at the surface of the Earth. To this aim, we have compiled different published chemical compositions of small rivers draining basalts. Basaltic river waters are characterised by relatively high Na-normalized molar ratios (Ca/Na: 0.2-3.9; HCO3/Na: 1-10; Mg/Na: 0.15-6) in comparison with those usually observed for river draining silicates. The data also show the climatic influence on basalt weathering and associated CO2 consumption. Runoff and temperature are the main parameters controlling the chemical weathering rate and derived CO2 consumption during basaltic weathering. From these relationships and digital maps, we are able to define the contribution of basalts to the global silicate flux. Taking account of this result, we estimate that the CO2 flux consumed by chemical weathering of basalts is about 4.08×1012 mol/year. The fluxes from the islands of Indonesia and regions of central America represent around 40% of this flux. The global flux of CO2 consumed by chemical weathering of basalts represents between 30% and 35% of the flux derived from continental silicate determined by Gaillardet et al. [Chem. Geol. 159 (1999) 3]. Finally, it appears that volcanic activity not only acts as a major atmospheric CO2 source, but also creates strong CO2 sinks that cannot be neglected to better understand the geochemical and climatic evolution of the Earth. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Pinpointing erosional 'hot spots' or sediment source areas within a watershed can be difficult because of the highly non-linear and episodic nature of effective runoff and sediment transport. Continuous monitoring of stream networks can provide insight into sediment source areas not possible from routine sampling by capturing episodic events and integrating entire storm events. This paper presents the results of a three-year study of spring snowmelt runoff in watersheds of Lake Tahoe, California, USA, using a network of nine nephelometric turbidometers. We estimate that montane badlands, comprising 1.2% of the Ward Creek watershed (25 km2), contributed 10-39% of snowmelt-derived suspended sediment load. The badlands are comprised of poorly-vegetated and deeply-incised gullies formed in parent material of Miocene volcanic mudflow breccia. The larger (29.5 km2) Blackwood Creek watershed also showed high relative erosion rates from volcanic terrain. Tributaries draining forested granitic and metasedimentary headwater regions had minimal sediment loads. Monitoring networks indicated that temporary main channel storage regulated release of fine sediment eroded from steep headwater slopes. This lag between erosion and delivery may lead to underestimation of gully erosion contribution to sediment budgets. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Since the Mesozoic, Africa has been under extension with shorter periods of compression associated with obduction of ophiolites on its northern margin. Less frequent than “normal” subduction, obduction is a first order process that remains enigmatic. The closure of the Neo-Tethys Ocean, by the Upper Cretaceous, is characterized by a major obduction event, from the Mediterranean region to the Himalayas, best represented around the Arabian Plate, from Cyprus to Oman. These ophiolites were all emplaced in a short time window in the Late Cretaceous, from $\sim$100 to 75 Ma, on the northern margin of Africa, in a context of compression over large parts of Africa and Europe, across the convergence zone. The scale of this process requires an explanation at the scale of several thousands of kilometres along strike, thus probably involving a large part of the convecting mantle. We suggest that alternating extension and compression in Africa could be explained by switching convection regimes. The extensional situation would correspond to steady-state whole-mantle convection, Africa being carried northward by a large-scale conveyor belt, while compression and obduction would occur when the African slab penetrates the upper-lower mantle transition zone and the African plate accelerates due to increasing plume activity, until full penetration of the Tethys slab in the lower mantle across the 660 km transition zone during a 25 Myr long period. The long-term geological archives on which such scenarios are founded can provide independent time constraints for testing numerical models of mantle convection and slab-plume interactions.},

More specifically, the domain considered herein, north of the R{\'{i}}o Grande Rise -Walvis Ridge barrier, was part of the warm-water "tropical" realm, but it was not part of the Mesogean domain because both Rudistids and Orbitolinas are missing. In addition, the scarcity of corals leads us to ascribe the taphonomic assemblage to the Chloralgal facies. Neither generalized hypersalinity or extreme sea-water tempe-ratures seem to account for these biotic peculiarities.

abstract = {The LMDZ4 general circulation model is the atmospheric component of the IPSL-CM4 coupled model which has been used to perform climate change simulations for the 4th IPCC assessment report. The main aspects of the model climatology (forced by observed sea surface temperature) are documented here, as well as the major improvements with respect to the previous versions, which mainly come form the parametrization of tropical convection. A methodology is proposed to help analyse the sensitivity of the tropical Hadley-Walker circulation to the parametrization of cumulus convection and clouds. The tropical circulation is characterized using scalar potentials associated with the horizontal wind and horizontal transport of geopotential (the Laplacian of which is proportional to the total vertical momentum in the atmospheric column). The effect of parametrized physics is analysed in a regime sorted framework using the vertical velocity at 500 hPa as a proxy for large scale vertical motion. Compared to Tiedtke's convection scheme, used in previous versions, the Emanuel's scheme improves the representation of the Hadley-Walker circulation, with a relatively stronger and deeper large scale vertical ascent over tropical continents, and suppresses the marked patterns of concentrated rainfall over oceans. Thanks to the regime sorted analyses, these differences are attributed to intrinsic differences in the vertical distribution of convective heating, and to the lack of self-inhibition by precipitating downdraughts in Tiedtke's parametrization. Both the convection and cloud schemes are shown to control the relative importance of large scale convection over land and ocean, an important point for the behaviour of the coupled model. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

The analysis is carried out over the southern African region (7.5°E-70°E, 10°S-40°S) for austral summer (November through February) for the period 1979-1980 to 2006-2007. The first five principal components (PC) are retained. The first two PCs describe spatial patterns oriented north-west to south-east from tropical southern Africa (SA) to the mid-latitudes. They are interpreted to be different possible locations for synoptic-scale tropical - temperate troughs (TTT), one dominant rainfall-producing synoptic system in the region. The phase relationship between these two PCs describes a tendency for these TTT to propagate eastwards from SA to the Mozambique Channel and southern Madagascar. The next three PCs describe convective fluctuations, respectively, located over the north-west, the south and the centre of SA. Their time series are significantly associated with Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) activity in the tropics. However, we find that TTT systems are statistically independent of the MJO, i.e. they are equally liable to occur during any phase of the MJO. Three PCs out of five also show a significant association with El Ni{\~{n}}o southern oscillation, confirming that El Ni{\~{n}}o years mostly coincide with suppressed convection at the intraseasonal time-scales, a result consistent with its impact on seasonal averages diagnosed in previous studies. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

The most compelling examples of climatic changes potentially related to AMOC abrupt variations, however, are found in high resolution palaeo-records from around the globe for the last glacial period. To study those more specifically, more and more fresh water hosing experiments have been performed under glacial conditions in the recent years. Here we compare an ensemble constituted by 11 such simulations run with 6 different climate models. All simulations follow a slightly different design, but are sufficiently close in their design to be compared. They all study the impact of a fresh water hosing imposed in the extra-tropical North Atlantic. Common features in the model responses to hosing are the cooling over the North Atlantic, extending along the sub-tropical gyre in the tropical North Atlantic, the southward shift of the Atlantic ITCZ and the weakening of the African and Indian monsoons. On the other hand, the expression of the bipolar see-saw, i.e., warming in the Southern Hemisphere, differs from model to model, with some restricting it to the South Atlantic and specific regions of the southern ocean while others simulate a widespread southern ocean warming. The relationships between the features common to most models, i.e., climate changes over the north and tropical Atlantic, African and Asian monsoon regions, are further quantified. These suggest a tight correlation between the temperature and precipitation changes over the extra-tropical North Atlantic, but different pathways for the teleconnections between the AMOC/North Atlantic region and the African and Indian monsoon regions.{\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

The models, calibrated against the historic record of glacier length where possible, were integrated until 2100. The differences in individual glacier responses are very large. No straightforward relationship between glacier size and fractional change of ice volume emerges for any given climate scenario. The hypsometry of individual glaciers and ice caps plays an important role in their response, thus making it difficult to generalize results. For a warming rate of 0.04 K a-1, without increase in precipitation, results indicate that few glaciers would survive until 2100. On the other hand, if the warming rate were to be limited to 0.01 K a-1 with an increase in precipitation of 10% per degree warming, we predict that overall loss would be restricted to 10 to 20% of the 1990 volume.},

Humid events occurred in the Dapingian, Sandbian, early Katian and Hirnantian (Ordovician) and in the Middle and Late Llandovery (Silurian). Juxtaposition with the sea-level curve shows correlation of five humid climate intervals with eustatic transgressions, suggesting global causes for these climatic changes.

In order to explore the oceanic palaeoredox changes, multiple geochemical proxies, including ratios of S/C, FeHR/FeT, FeP/FeHR and DOP values, are presented here from three sections (Wangjiawan, western Hubei, Sanjiaguan, northern Hunan, and Nanbazi, northern Guizhou) across the Ordo-Silurian boundary on the Yangtze Platform. These palaeoredox data indicate a predominance of stratified, anoxic (ferruginous) ocean on the Yangtze block during this transition, which was interrupted by a brief episode of oceanic oxygenation in the early Hirnantian. This oxygenation, temporally coinciding with the end-Ordovician glaciation and global glacio-eustatic sea level fall, likely resulted from enhanced circulation of polar cold, dense oxygen-rich water onto the low-latitude shelf. The prior and subsequent longer-term episodes of anoxic ocean, particularly the later one which started in the late Hirnantian, occurred in parallel with the rapid climatic warming and sea level rise, which could have slowed down oceanic circulation, thereby enhancing oceanic stratification, anoxia and organic preservation. Oceanic redox changes, together with rapid climatic and sea-level fluctuations, were likely responsible for the stepwise massive demise of the Ordo-Silurian biotic crisis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Neodymium (Nd) isotope composition of fish remains has been widely used to track past changes in oceanic circulation. Although the number of published Nd isotope data for the Cretaceous has markedly increased in the last years, no consensus has been reached on the structure of the oceanic circulation and its evolution during the Late Cretaceous. Yet this period is characterised by major geodynamical and climatic changes and marked by the disappearance of global oceanic anoxic events in which changes in oceanic circulation modes may have played a significant role.In this study we present the first record of Nd isotopic composition of fish remains from continental margin environments on the northwestern Pacific margin (Yezo Group in the Hokkaidō area, Northern Japan) for the Late Cretaceous period. This record, interpreted in terms of Nd isotopic composition of local neritic seafloor seawater, is characterised by relatively radiogenic Nd isotope compositions and presents variations of several $\epsilon$-units from the Turonian to the Campanian ranging from $\sim$. -. 5.5 to $\sim$. 0.5 $\epsilon$-units, although most values remain in the $\sim$. -. 1 to $\sim$. -. 3 range. Conversely, the local detrital fraction remains more constant and around -. 4 $\epsilon$-units on the studied interval. This new set of seawater Nd data contains some of the most radiogenic values for the Cretaceous published yet. The more radiogenic seawater Nd isotope values compared to that of the sediments points to an input of radiogenic seawater in the studied area by surface currents during the Late Cretaceous. Similarly to the modern configuration, these radiogenic waters could have been conveyed in the studied area by a southward current comparable to the modern Oyashio current bathing the Hokkaidō area. Our data are then consistent with the presence in the northern Pacific of highly radiogenic seawater, and support the northern and northwestern Pacific as a possible radiogenic source for the deep parts of the basin. As such this work represents a first step toward a better characterisation of the various end-members that could have contributed to the Nd isotopic signature of the deep-water masses filling the Cretaceous oceans. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {General circulation models (GCMs) are useful tools for investigating the characteristics and dynamics of past climates. Understanding of past climates contributes significantly to our overall understanding of Earth's climate system. One of the most time consuming, and often daunting, tasks facing the paleoclimate modeler, particularly those without a geological background, is the production of surface boundary conditions for past time periods. These boundary conditions consist of, at a minimum, continental configurations derived from plate tectonic modeling, topography, bathymetry, and a vegetation distribution. Typically, each researcher develops a unique set of boundary conditions for use in their simulations. Thus, unlike simulations of modern climate, basic assumptions in paleo surface boundary conditions can vary from researcher to researcher. This makes comparisons between results from multiple researchers difficult and, thus, hinders the integration of studies across the broader community. Unless special changes to surface conditions are warranted, researcher dependent boundary conditions are not the most efficient way to proceed in paleoclimate investigations. Here we present surface boundary conditions (land-sea distribution, paleotopography, paleobathymetry, and paleovegetation distribution) for four Cretaceous time slices (120Ma, 110Ma, 90Ma, and 70Ma). These boundary conditions are modified from base datasets to be appropriate for incorporation into numerical studies of Earth's climate and are available in NetCDF format upon request from the lead author. The land-sea distribution, bathymetry, and topography are based on the 1° × 1° (latitude × longitude) paleo Digital Elevation Models (paleoDEMs) of Christopher Scotese. Those paleoDEMs were adjusted using the paleogeographical reconstructions of Ronald Blakey (Northern Arizona University) and published literature and were then modified for use in GCMs. The paleovegetation distribution is based on published data and reconstructions and consultation with members of the paleobotanical community and is represented as generalized biomes that should be easily translatable to many vegetation-modeling schemes.},

abstract = {We investigate the late Paleocene/early Eocene (PE) climate using the coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice model ECHAM5/MPI-OM. The surface in our PE control simulation is on average 297K warm and ice-free, despite a moderate atmospheric CO2 concentration of 560 ppm. Compared to a pre-industrial reference simulation (PR), low latitudes are 5 to 8K warmer, while high latitudes are up to 40K warmer. This high-latitude amplification is in line with proxy data, yet a comparison to sea surface temperature proxy data suggests that the Arctic surface temperatures are still too low in our PE simulation. To identify the mechanisms that cause the PE-PR surface temperature differences, we fit two simple energy balance models to the ECHAM5/MPI-OM results. We find that about 2/3 of the PE-PR global mean surface temperature difference are caused by a smaller clear sky emissivity due to higher atmospheric CO2 and water vapour concentrations in PE compared to PR; 1/3 is due to a smaller planetary albedo. The reduction of the pole-to-equator temperature gradient in PE compared to PR is due to (1) the large high-latitude effect of the higher CO2 and water vapour concentrations in PE compared to PR, (2) the lower Antarctic orography, (3) the smaller surface albedo at high latitudes, and (4) longwave cloud radiative effects. Our results support the hypothesis that local radiative effects rather than increased meridional heat transports were responsible for the "equable" PE climate. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2009.},

abstract = {Sea ice has been suggested, based on simple models, to play an important role in past glacial-interglacial oscillations via the so-called "sea-ice switch" mechanism. An important requirement for this mechanism is that multiple sea-ice extents exist under the same land ice configuration. This hypothesis of multiple sea-ice extents is tested with a state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model coupled to an atmospheric energy-moisture-balance model. The model includes a dynamic-thermodynamic sea-ice module, has a realistic ocean configuration and bathymetry, and is forced by annual mean forcing. Several runs with two different land ice distributions represent present-day and cold-climate conditions. In each case the ocean model is initiated with both ice-free and fully ice-covered states. We find that the present-day runs converge approximately to the same sea-ice state for the northern hemisphere while for the southern hemisphere a difference in sea-ice extent of about three degrees in latitude between the different runs is observed. The cold climate runs lead to meridional sea-ice extents that are different by up to four degrees in latitude in both hemispheres. While approaching the final states, the model exhibits abrupt transitions from extended sea-ice states and weak meridional overturning circulation, to less extended sea ice and stronger meridional overturning circulation, and vice versa. These transitions are linked to temperature changes in the North Atlantic high-latitude deep water. Such abrupt changes may be associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events, as proposed by previous studies. Although multiple sea ice states have been observed, the difference between these states is not large enough to provide a strong support for the sea-ice-switch mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Idealized ocean models are known to develop intrinsic multidecadal oscillations of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC). Here we explore the role of ocean–atmosphere interactions on this low-frequency variability. We use a coupled ocean–atmosphere model set up in a flat-bottom aquaplanet geometry with two meridional boundaries. The model is run at three different horizontal resolutions (4°, 2° and 1°) in both the ocean and atmosphere. At all resolutions, the MOC exhibits spontaneous variability on multidecadal timescales in the range 30–40 years, associated with the propagation of large-scale baroclinic Rossby waves across the Atlantic-like basin. The unstable region of growth of these waves through the long wave limit of baroclinic instability shifts from the eastern boundary at coarse resolution to the western boundary at higher resolution. Increasing the horizontal resolution enhances both intrinsic atmospheric variability and ocean–atmosphere interactions. In particular, the simulated atmospheric annular mode becomes significantly correlated to the MOC variability at 1° resolution. An ocean-only simulation conducted for this specific case underscores the disruptive but not essential influence of air–sea interactions on the low-frequency variability. This study demonstrates that an atmospheric annular mode leading MOC changes by about 2 years (as found at 1° resolution) does not imply that the low-frequency variability originates from air–sea interactions.},

Since understanding the termination of the fully ice-covered state is essential to sustain, or not, the snowball Earth theory, we used an Atmospheric General Climate Model (AGCM) to explore some key factors which could induce deglaciation. After testing the models' sensitivity to their parameterizations of clouds, CO2 and snow, we investigated the warming effect caused by a dusty surface, associated with ash release during a mega-volcanic eruption. We found that the snow aging process, its dirtiness and the ash deposition on the snow-free ice are key factors for deglaciation. Our modelling study suggests that, under a CO2 enriched atmosphere, a dusty snowball Earth could reach the deglaciation threshold. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {This study examines the mutual interaction between topographically-forced atmospheric stationary waves and continental-scale ice sheets using a thermomechanical ice-sheet model coupled to a linear as well as a fully-nonlinear dry atmospheric primitive equation model. The focus is on how the stationary-wave induced ablation feeds back on the ice sheet. Simulations are conducted in which an embryonal ice mass, on an idealised "North American" continent, evolves to an equilibrium ice sheet. Under the coupling to the linear atmospheric model, the equilibrium ice sheet is primarily controlled by the ratio between the wavelength of the stationary waves and the zonal continental extent. When this ratio is near two, the ice sheet has its center of mass shifted far eastward and its shape is broadly reminiscent of the Laurentide ice sheet at LGM. For wavelengths comparable to the continental extent, however, the ice margin extends far equatorward on the central continent but is displaced poleward near the eastern coast. Remarkably, the coupling to the nonlinear atmospheric model yields equilibrium ice sheets that are virtually identical to the ones obtained in uncoupled simulations, i. e. a symmetric ice sheet with a zonal southern margin. Thus, the degree of linearity of the atmospheric response should control to what extent topographically-forced stationary waves can reorganise the structure of ice sheets. If the stationary-wave response is linear, the present results suggest that spatial reconstructions of past ice sheets can provide some information on the zonal-mean atmospheric circulation that prevailed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The first comparative and systematic climate model study of the sensitivity of the climate response under Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) conditions to freshwater perturbations at various locations that are known to have received significant amounts of freshwater during the LGM (21 kyr BP) climate conditions is presented. A series of ten regions representative of those receiving most of the meltwater from decaying ice-sheets during the deglaciation is defined, comprising the border of LGM ice-sheets, outlets of rivers draining part of the melting ice-sheets and iceberg melt zones. The effect of several given freshwater fluxes applied separately in each of these regions on regional and global climate is subsequently tested. The climate response is then analysed both for the atmosphere and oceans. Amongst the regions defined, it is found that the area close by and dynamically upstream to the main deep water formation zone in the North Atlantic are most sensitive to freshwater pulses, as is expected. However, some important differences between Arctic freshwater forcing and Nordic Seas forcing are found, the former having a longer term response linked to sea-ice formation and advection whereas the latter exhibits more direct influence of direct freshening of the deep water formation sites. Combining the common surface temperature response for each respective zone, we fingerprint the particular surface temperature response obtained by adding freshwater in a particular location. This is done to examine if a surface climate response can be used to determine the origin of a meltwater flux, which is relevant for the interpretation of proxy data. We show that it is indeed possible to generally classify the fingerprints by their origin in terms of sea-ice modification and modification of deep-water formation. Whilst the latter is not an unambiguous characterization of each zone, it nonetheless provides important clues on the physical mechanisms at work. In particular, it is shown that in order to obtain a consistent see-saw temperature pattern, addition of freshwater in the Northern Hemisphere at sites dynamically close to the deep water formation zones is needed. Finally a preliminary data-model comparison for the time of the Heinrich event 1 suggests that those sites are indeed the most favourable to explain the pattern of climate variability recorded in proxy data for this period. More importantly, this model-data comparison enables us to clearly reject a substantial fraction of the zones tested as potential source for large freshwater entering the ocean at that time. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

An assessment of the model performances is done by using available observational datasets. Despite a persistent bias, the PROTHEUS system is able to capture the inter-annual variability of seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) and also the fine scale spatio-temporal evolution of observed SST anomalies, with spatial correlation as high as 0.7 during summer. The close inspection of a 10-day strong wind event during the summer of 2000 proves the capability of the PROTHEUS system to correctly describe the daily evolution of SST under strong air-sea interaction conditions.

The most compelling examples of climatic changes potentially related to AMOC abrupt variations, however, are found in high resolution palaeo-records from around the globe for the last glacial period. To study those more specifically, more and more fresh water hosing experiments have been performed under glacial conditions in the recent years. Here we compare an ensemble constituted by 11 such simulations run with 6 different climate models. All simulations follow a slightly different design, but are sufficiently close in their design to be compared. They all study the impact of a fresh water hosing imposed in the extra-tropical North Atlantic. Common features in the model responses to hosing are the cooling over the North Atlantic, extending along the sub-tropical gyre in the tropical North Atlantic, the southward shift of the Atlantic ITCZ and the weakening of the African and Indian monsoons. On the other hand, the expression of the bipolar see-saw, i.e., warming in the Southern Hemisphere, differs from model to model, with some restricting it to the South Atlantic and specific regions of the southern ocean while others simulate a widespread southern ocean warming. The relationships between the features common to most models, i.e., climate changes over the north and tropical Atlantic, African and Asian monsoon regions, are further quantified. These suggest a tight correlation between the temperature and precipitation changes over the extra-tropical North Atlantic, but different pathways for the teleconnections between the AMOC/North Atlantic region and the African and Indian monsoon regions.{\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {The development of large continental-scale ice sheets over Canada and northern Europe during the last glacial cycle likely modified the track of stationary waves and influenced the location of growing ice sheets through changes in accumulation and temperature patterns. Although they are often mentioned in the literature, these feedback mechanisms are poorly constrained and have never been studied throughout an entire glacial-interglacial cycle. Using the climate model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-2 coupled with the 3-D ice-sheet model GRISLI (GRenoble Ice Shelf and Land Ice model), we investigate the impact of stationary waves on the construction of past Northern Hemisphere ice sheets during the past glaciation. The stationary waves are not explicitly computed in the model but their effect on sea-level pressure is parameterized. We tested different parameterizations to study separately the effect of surface temperature (thermal forcing) and topography (orographic forcing) on sea-level pressure, and therefore on atmospheric circulation and ice-sheet surface mass balance. Our model results suggest that the response of ice sheets to thermal and/or orographic forcings is rather different. At the beginning of the glaciation, the orographic effect favors the growth of the Laurentide ice sheet, whereas Fennoscandia appears rather sensitive to the thermal effect. Using the ablation parameterization as a trigger to artificially modify the size of one ice sheet, the remote influence of one ice sheet on the other is also studied as a function of the stationary wave parameterizations. The sensitivity of remote ice sheets is shown to be highly sensitive to the choice of these parameterizations with a larger response when orographic effect is accounted for. Results presented in this study suggest that the various spatial distributions of ice sheets could be partly explained by the feedback mechanisms occurring between ice sheets and atmospheric circulation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

abstract = {Some geochemical and geological evidence has been interpreted to suggest that the concentration of atmospheric oxygen was only 1-10 % of the present level in the time interval from 750 to 580 million years ago when several nearly global glaciations or Snowball Earth events occurred. This low concentration of oxygen would have been accompanied by a lower ozone concentration than exists at present. Since ozone is a greenhouse gas, this change in ozone concentration would alter surface temperature, and thereby could have an important influence on the climate of the Snowball Earth. Previous works that have focused either on initiation or deglaciation of the proposed Snowball Earth has not taken the radiative effects of ozone changes into account. We address this issue herein by performing a series of simulations using an atmospheric general circulation model with various ozone concentrations. Our simulation results demonstrate that, as ozone concentration is uniformly reduced from 100 % to 50 %, surface temperature decreases by approximately 0.8 K at the Equator, with the largest decreases located in the middle latitudes reaching as high as 2.5 K. When ozone concentration is reduced and its vertical and horizontal distribution is simultaneously modulated, surface temperature decreases by 0.4-1.0 K at the Equator and by 4-7 K in polar regions. These results here have uncertainties, depending on model parameterizations of cloud, surface snow albedo, and relevant feedback processes, while they are qualitatively consistent with radiative-convective model results that do not involve such parameterizations and feedbacks. These results suggest that ozone variations could have had a moderate impact on the climate during the Neoproterozoic glaciations. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {In this study, we compare the simulated climatic impact of adding an Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) to the "greenhouse world" of the Eocene and removing the AIS from the modern world. The modern global mean surface temperature anomaly (&Delta;T) induced by Antarctic Glaciation depends on the background CO2 levels and ranges from -1.22 to -0.18 K. The Eocene &Delta;T is nearly constant at ∼-0.25 K. We calculate an climate sensitivity parameter S[Antarctica] which we define as &Delta;T divided by the change in effective radiative forcing (&Delta;QAntarctica) which includes some fast feedbacks imposed by prescribing the glacial properties of Antarctica. <br><br> The main difference between the modern and Eocene responses is that a negative cloud feedback warms much of the Earth's surface as a large AIS is introduced in the Eocene, whereas this cloud feedback is weakly positive and acts in combination with positive sea-ice feedbacks to enhance cooling introduced by adding an ice sheet in the modern. Because of the importance of cloud feedbacks in determining the final temperature sensitivity of the AIS, our results are likely to be model dependent. Nevertheless, these model results suggest that the effective radiative forcing and feedbacks induced by the AIS did not significantly decrease global mean surface temperature across the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT -34.1 to 33.6 Ma) and that other factors like declining atmospheric CO2 are more important for cooling across the EOT. The results illustrate that the efficacy of AIS forcing in the Eocene is not necessarily close to one and is likely to be model and state dependent. This implies that using EOT paleoclimate proxy data by itself to estimate climate sensitivity for future climate prediction requires climate models and consequently these estimates will have large uncertainty, largely due to uncertainties in modelling low clouds. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

Carbonate compensation is accounted for in these simulations. We show that neither iron fertilization nor the sinking of brines alone can account for the evolution of CO2, and that only the combination of the sinking of brines and interactive diffusion can simultaneously simulate the increase in deep Southern Ocean &delta;13C. The scenario that agrees best with the data takes into account all mechanisms and favours a rapid cessation of the sinking of brines around 18 000 years ago, when the Antarctic ice sheet extent was at its maximum. In this scenario, we make the hypothesis that sea ice formation was then shifted to the open ocean where the salty water is quickly mixed with fresher water, which prevents deep sinking of salty water and therefore breaks down the deep stratification and releases carbon from the abyss. Based on this scenario, it is possible to simulate both the amplitude and timing of the long-term CO2 increase during the last termination in agreement with ice core data. The atmospheric &delta;13C appears to be highly sensitive to changes in the terrestrial biosphere, underlining the need to better constrain the vegetation evolution during the termination.{\textcopyright} Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {For a long time, evaporitic sequences have been interpreted as indicative of an arid climate. Such systematic interpretations led to the suggestion that the Central segment of the South Atlantic (20-0{\^{A}}°) was characterized by an arid climate during the upper Aptian. Indeed, synchronous to this period that corresponds to the rifting and to the opening of this part of the South Atlantic, a large evaporitic sequence spreads out from the equator to 20° S. Using the fully ocean atmosphere coupled model FOAM, we test the potential for the Aptian geography to produce an arid area over the Central segment. Sensitivity to the altitude of the rift shoulders separating the Africa and the South America cratons, to the water depth of the Central segment and to the drainage pattern have been performed. Using seawater salinity as a diagnostic, our simulations show that the southern part of the Central segment is characterized by very high salinity in the case of catchment areas draining the water out of the Central segment. Conversely, whatever the boundary conditions used, the northern part of the Central segment remains humid and salinities are very low. Hence, we conclude that the evaporites deposited in the southern part of the Central segment may have been controlled by the climate favouring aridity and high saline waters. In contrast, the evaporites of the northern part can hardly be reconciled with the climatic conditions occurring there and may be due to hydrothermal sources. Our interpretations are in agreement with the gradient found in the mineralogical compositions of the evaporites from the North to the South, i.e. the northern evaporites are at least 4 times more concentrated than the southern one. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

abstract = {During the cold period of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, about 21 000 years ago) atmospheric CO2 was around 190 ppm, much lower than the pre-industrial concentration of 280 ppm. The causes of this substantial drop remain partially unresolved, despite intense research. Understanding the origin of reduced atmospheric CO2 during glacial times is crucial to comprehend the evolution of the different carbon reservoirs within the Earth system (atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere and ocean). In this context, the ocean is believed to play a major role as it can store large amounts of carbon, especially in the abyss, which is a carbon reservoir that is thought to have expanded during glacial times. To create this larger reservoir, one possible mechanism is to produce very dense glacial waters, thereby stratifying the deep ocean and reducing the carbon exchange between the deep and upper ocean. The existence of such very dense waters has been inferred in the LGM deep Atlantic from sediment pore water salinity and $\delta$18O inferred temperature. Based on these observations, we study the impact of a brine mechanism on the glacial carbon cycle. This mechanism relies on the formation and rapid sinking of brines, very salty water released during sea ice formation, which brings salty dense water down to the bottom of the ocean. It provides two major features: A direct link from the surface to the deep ocean along with an efficient way of setting a strong stratification. We show with the CLIMBER-2 carbon-climate model that such a brine mechanism can account for a significant decrease in atmospheric CO2 and contribute to the glacial-interglacial change. This mechanism can be amplified by low vertical diffusion resulting from the brine-induced stratification. The modeled glacial distribution of oceanic $\delta$13C as well as the deep ocean salinity are substantially improved and better agree with reconstructions from sediment cores, suggesting that such a mechanism could have played an important role during glacial times. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {One of the critical issues of the Snowball Earth hypothesis is the CO 2 threshold for triggering the deglaciation. Using Community Atmospheric Model version 3.0 (CAM3), we study the problem for the CO 2 threshold. Our simulations show large differences from previous results (e.g. Pierrehumbert, 2004, 2005; Le Hir et al., 2007). At 0.2 bars of CO2, the January maximum near-surface temperature is about 268 K, about 13 K higher than that in Pierrehumbert (2004, 2005), but lower than the value of 270 K for 0.1 bar of CO2 in Le Hir et al. (2007). It is found that the difference of simulation results is mainly due to model sensitivity of greenhouse effect and longwave cloud forcing to increasing CO2. At 0.2 bars of CO2, CAM3 yields 117 Wm-2 of clear-sky greenhouse effect and 32 Wm-2 of longwave cloud forcing, versus only about 77 Wm-2 and 10.5 Wm-2 in Pierrehumbert (2004, 2005), respectively. CAM3 has comparable clear-sky greenhouse effect to that in Le Hir et al. (2007), but lower longwave cloud forcing. CAM3 also produces much stronger Hadley cells than that in Pierrehumbert (2005). Effects of pressure broadening and collision-induced absorption are also studied using a radiative-convective model and CAM3. Both effects substantially increase surface temperature and thus lower the CO2 threshold. The radiative-convective model yields a CO2 threshold of about 0.21 bars with surface albedo of 0.663. Without considering the effects of pressure broadening and collision-induced absorption, CAM3 yields an approximate CO 2 threshold of about 1.0 bar for surface albedo of about 0.6. However, the threshold is lowered to 0.38 bars as both effects are considered. {\textcopyright} 2011 Author(s).},

abstract = {The phylogeographical evolution and the consequent changing distribution and diversity of rhynchonelliform brachiopods through the Ordovician are linked to the dynamic palaeogeography of the period. The Early Ordovician (Tremadocian and Floian) is characterized by globally low-diversity faunas with local biodiversity epicentres, notably on the South China Palaeoplate; low-latitude porambonitoid-dominated faunas with early plectambonitoid and clitambonitoid representatives, as well as high-latitude assemblages mostly dominated by orthoids, can be recognized, but many taxa are rooted in Late Cambrian stocks. The Early Ordovician displays a steady increase in rhynchonelliformean biodiversity, which was mostly driven by the increasing success of the Porambonitoidea and Orthoidea, but the billingsellids and early plectambonitoids also contributed to this expansion. During the Early to Mid Ordovician (Dapingian-Darriwilian), marine life experienced an unprecedented hike in diversity at the species, genus and family levels that firmly installed the suspension-feeding benthos as the main component of the Palaeozoic fauna. However, this may have occurred in response to an early Darriwilian annihilation of existing clades, some of which had been most successful during the Early Ordovician. New clades rapidly expanded. The continents were widely dispersed together with a large number of microcontinents and volcanic arcs related to intense magmatic and tectonic activity. Climates were warm and sea-levels were high. Pivotal to the entire diversification is the role of gamma (inter-provincial) diversity and by implication the spread of the continents and frequency of island arcs and microcontinents. The phylogeographical analysis demonstrates that this new palaeogeographical configuration was particularly well explored and utilized by the strophomenides, especially the Plectambonitoidea, which radiated rapidly during this interval. The porambonitoids, on the other hand, were still in recovery following the early Darriwilian extinctions. Orthides remained dominant, particularly at high latitudes. Biodiversity epicentres were located on most of the larger palaeoplates, as well as within the Iapetus Ocean. Provincial patterns were disrupted during the Sandbian and early Katian with the migration of many elements of the benthos into deeper-water regimes, enjoying a more cosmopolitan distribution. Later Katian faunas exhibit a partition between carbonate and clastic environments. During the latest Katian, biogeographical patterns were disrupted by polewards migrations of warm-water taxa in response to the changing climate; possibly as a consequence of low-latitude cradles being developed in, for instance, carbonate reef settings. Many clades were well established with especially the strophomenides beginning to outnumber the previously successful orthides, although this process had already begun, regionally, in the mid to late Darriwilian. At the same time, atrypoid and pentameroid clades also began to radiate in low-latitude faunas, anticipating their dominance in Silurian faunas. The Hirnantian was marked by severe extinctions particularly across orthidestrophomenide clades within the context of few, but well-defined, climatically controlled provincial belts. {\textcopyright} The Geological Society of London 2013.},

abstract = {New palaeogeographical reconstructions are presented at 10 myr intervals from the Lower Cambrian at 540 Ma to the Lower Devonian at 400 Ma, showing continental crustal fragments and oceans (not lands and seas), with appropriate kinematic continuity between successive maps. The maps were chiefly generated by revised and selected palaeomagnetic data and revised Apparent Polar Wandering paths linked to present-day polygons from the main continents. These have been reinforced by analysis of the distributions of some fossils and sediments. Gondwana was the dominating supercontinent from its final assembly in the Latest Neoproterozoic at about 550 Ma until the Carboniferous, and covered much of the Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere was largely occupied by the vast Panthalassic Ocean. The relative positions of the major continents and the latitudes and rotation histories of Gondwana, Baltica, Siberia and Laurentia (Laurussia from the mid-Silurian) are now well known. Although Laurentia was oriented in a similar direction to the present, Siberia was inverted throughout the Lower Palaeozoic, and Baltica too was initially inverted, but rotated through 120° between the Late Cambrian and Late Ordovician before collision with Laurentia in the mid-Silurian Caledonide Orogeny. Through reconstructions of the Caledonide and some other orogenies, the progressive history of the Iapetus Ocean between Laurentia and Baltica/Gondwana is well constrained. Less major continents whose positions are also well known include Avalonia (initially peri-Gondwanan but migrating in the Early Ordovician to join Baltica by the end of the Ordovician), Sibumasu (now considered an integral part of Gondwana) and Mongolia (adjacent to Siberia). A large number of other terranes are reviewed and plotted on the reconstructions with varying degrees of certainty. However, significant continents with less well constrained or controversial positions are South China, North China (Sinokorea), Annamia (Indochina) and Arctic Alaska-Chukotka. The European areas of France, Iberia and southern Italy, previously considered by some as a separate Armorican Terrane Assemblage, remained parts of core Gondwana until the opening of the Palaeotethys Ocean near the end of the Silurian, but it is uncertain whether Perunica (Bohemia) was one of that group or whether it left Gondwana during the Middle Ordovician. {\textcopyright}The Geological Society of London 2013.},

abstract = {The biogeographical patterns shown by Ordovician linguliform and craniiform brachiopods are greatly influenced by their dominance in low-diversity associations in marginal environments. This is particularly evident in the Early Ordovician, when linguliform-dominated dysaerobic assemblages are widely distributed along the deep shelves of Gondwana, the Kazakhstanian terranes and in Baltica. By the Darriwilian, micromorphic linguliforms are characteristic components of the pantropical climatic-controlled faunas of Laurentia, Cuyania and Kazakhstanian terranes, which - in spite of separation by extensive oceans - retain a distinct similarity. Analysis of craniiform biogeographical distribution is impeded significantly by the poor state of craniide taxonomy and lack of reliable data from most regions. However, in general their biogeographical dispersion is similar to other groups of the Palaeozoic Evolutionary Fauna. Unlike the linguliforms, which are important members of the Cambrian Evolutionary Fauna, there is no convincing Cambrian craniiform record; they may have evolved and dispersed from Gondwana and associated microcontinents and island arcs. The earliest well-established record is from the late Tremadocian of temperate to high-latitude peri-Gondwana. During most of the Ordovician, they have a peri-Iapetus distribution. They are very rare or absent in tropical Gondwana, South China and Kazakhstanian terranes and are not yet documented from Siberia. The trimerellides probably evolved in tropical peri-Gondwanan island arc settings. Their dispersion and major features of biogeography mirror those of atrypides. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2013.},

Palaeozoic phytoplankton assemblages show varying degrees of cosmopolitanism and endemism through time. A high degree of cosmopolitanism was evidently characteristic of the Cambrian and much of the Late Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian, but provincialism was more marked in the Early Ordovician and Hirnantian (latest Ordovician), the latter at a time of major palaeoenvironmental perturbations. Distribution patterns of Palaeozoic phytoplankton are attributed to a number of interacting factors, including palaeolatitude, palaeotemperature, oceanic circulation patterns, the disposition of continents, differentiation between oceanic and cratonic (distal-proximal) assemblages, and sedimentary environments and facies. There are indications that biogeographical ranges of taxa shift over time. Moving our understanding of Palaeozoic phytoplankton biogeography forward requires (1) targeted investigation of regions and time periods for which no or little data exist, (2) quantitative analysis of data to investigate how similarity between regions varies through time and how this might correlate with other datasets such as carbon isotope stratigraphy or sea-level, and (3) rigorous application of well-defined time slices to compare coeval assemblages, at least within the limits of resolution {\textcopyright} The Authors 2013.},

The low diversity of this Avalonian ostracod fauna contrasts with more diverse (tens of species), coeval ostracod faunas from Laurentia and Baltica. The association of Darriwilian ostracods and trilobites from New Brunswick demonstrates continuing exchange of open marine, cool water biota between Avalonia, Baltica, and West and North Gondwana that began in the late early Cambrian. },

abstract = {"Bryophytes, which are important constituents of ecosystems globally and often dominate carbon and water dynamics at high latitudes and elevations, were also among the pioneers of terrestrial photosynthesis. Consequently, in addition to their present day ecological value, modern representatives of these groups contain the legacy of adaptations that led to the greening of Earth. This volume brings together experts on bryophyte photosynthesis whose research spans the genome and cell through whole plant and ecosystem function and combines that with historical perspectives on the role of algal, bryophyte and vascular plant ancestors on terrestrialization of the Earth. The volume begins with an overview of what can be learned from bryophyte photosynthesis followed by the consideration of fossil, biogeochemical, systematic and comparative physiological evidence to understand three phases of terrestrialization: the transition to land from aquatic algal ancestors, the physiological adaptation of early land plants, and the diversification of plants and environments. Then the volume introduces new perspectives and reviews photosynthetic physiology across spatial and temporal scales in seven chapters that focus on the unique strategies of bryophytes in relation to genomics, carbon acquisition, chloroplast movement, photoprotection and canopy structure and on novel approaches to investigating bryophyte photosynthesis. After these perspectives, the volume emphasizes the ecological setting, showing how the photosynthetic physiology of bryophytes plays out within aquatic, peatland, tropical, dryland and Antarctic settings with discussions of implications of global change. Finally, the volume ends with a discussion of opportunities in bryophyte photosynthesis research and some useful resources. Overall, the eighteen well-illustrated chapters reveal unique physiological approaches to achieving carbon balance and dealing with environmental limitations and stresses that present an alternative, yet successful strategy for land plants"--Provided by publisher.

abstract = {The Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT), $\sim$34 Ma, marks a tipping point in the long-term Cenozoic greenhouse to icehouse climate transition. Paleorecords reveal stepwise rapid cooling and ice growth across the EOT tightly coupled to a transient benthic $\delta$13C excursion and a major and permanent deepening of the carbonate compensation depth (CCD). Based on biogeochemical box modeling, Merico et al. (2008) suggested that a combination of (1) glacioeustatic sea level fall-induced shelf-basin carbonate burial fractionation and (2) shelf carbonate weathering can account for the carbon cycle perturbation, but this finding has been questioned. Alternative proposed mechanisms include increased ocean ventilation, decreased carbonate burial, increased organic carbon burial, increased silicate weathering, and increased ocean calcium concentration. Here we use an improved version of the biogeochemical box model of Merico et al. (2008) to reevaluate these competing hypotheses and an additional mechanism, the expansion of "carbon capacitors" such as permafrost and peatlands. We find that changes in calcium concentration, silicate weathering, and carbonate or organic carbon burial each yield a response that is fundamentally at odds with the form and/or sign of the paleorecords. Shelf-basin carbonate burial fractionation (CCD change), plus shelf carbonate weathering, sequestration of 12C-enriched carbon into carbon capacitors, and possibly increased ocean ventilation ($\delta$13C excursion), offers the best fit to the paleorecords. Further work is needed to understand why the EOT carbon cycle perturbation is so unique when the forcing mechanisms hypothesized to be responsible (cooling and ice growth) are not peculiar to this event.},

abstract = {During the Hirnantian (443 Ma), ice sheets expanded toward the present-day north over North Africa and the Arabian peninsula as the western part of the Gondwana supercontinent straddled the South Pole. A glacigenic succession is exposed around the flanks of several Saharan cratonic basins, including the Murzuq and Al Kufrah basins in Libya. Owing to the present-day hyperarid context of the outcrops, a suite of palaeo-glacial landforms can be identified and in some cases mapped. These landforms occur along glacial erosion surfaces, defined as unconformities derived through direct ice-sculpting, meltwater erosion, or a combination thereof. Unconformities, mostly resulting from ice sculpting, include glacially striated pavements, and at a number of locations mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs) can be identified along these, in concert with drumlinized features. Most, but not all, reported examples are of " soft sediment character " ; that is, generated through the deformation of unconsolidated sediment. Features mainly associated with meltwater erosion include tunnel valleys, which occur in swarm-like belts, defining palaeo-grounding line positions as the ice fronts retreated. A " smeared " series of palaeo-ice stream footprints, resulting from multiple-advance retreat cycles, is characteristic of the landsystem. Deformation of sediments into a series of push moraines, expressed as km-scale fold and thrust belts, allows the locations of the former ice front to be identified.

abstract = {The response of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) to changing climate forcings is an important driver of sea-level changes. Anthropogenic climate change may drive a sizeable AIS tipping point response with subsequent increases in coastal flooding risks. Many studies analyzing flood risks use simple models to project the future responses of AIS and its sea-level contributions. These analyses have provided important new insights, but they are often silent on the effects of potentially important processes such as Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI) or Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI). These approximations can be well justified and result in more parsimonious and transparent model structures. This raises the question of how this approximation impacts hindcasts and projections. Here, we calibrate a previously published and relatively simple AIS model, which neglects the effects of MICI and regional characteristics, using a combination of observational constraints and a Bayesian inversion method. Specifically, we approximate the effects of missing MICI by comparing our results to those from expert assessments with more realistic models and quantify the bias during the last interglacial when MICI may have been triggered. Our results suggest that the model can approximate the process of MISI and reproduce the projected median melt from some previous expert assessments in the year 2100. Yet, our mean hindcast is roughly 3/4 of the observed data during the last interglacial period and our mean projection is roughly 1/6 and 1/10 of the mean from a model accounting for MICI in the year 2100. These results suggest that missing MICI and/or regional characteristics can lead to a low-bias during warming period AIS melting and hence a potential low-bias in projected sea levels and flood risks.},

abstract = {Silurian organic-rich (hot) shales were the source of large amounts hydrocarbons in northern Gondwana, with supergiant and giant fields in the Middle East and North Africa. A study of these black shales has been conducted in Jordan, where they represent the source for the Risha gas field. Two organically enriched horizons occur in the Silurian in Jordan, termed the lower hot shale and the upper hot shale. Deposition of the transgressive lower hot shale occurred during the early Llandoverian and was restricted to the earliest Silurian paleodepressions. Three lower hot shale depocenters have been identified in Jordan; they are located in the western Risha, eastern Wadi Sirhan, and Jafr areas. The eastern Risha area was part of a larger scale paleohigh covering northeast Jordan, most of Syria and Iraq, and north-central Saudi Arabia (Qusaiba area). At least in Jordan, the high coincides with the depocenter of the latest Ordovician glaciation. Sedimentation of the upper hot shale occurred around peak sea level during the late Llandoverian and/or early Wenlockian and was limited to the distal parts of the shelf (Risha area), in front of the prograding silty-sandy deltaic front. Thermal maturity increases from immature in the Southern Desert outcrops to late or postmature in northern Jordan. Organic richness and pyrolysis data deteriorate significantly with increasing thermal maturity because of hydrocarbon generation. Prior to maturation, maximum organic richness is interpreted to have considerably exceeded 10% with good S2(remaining generative potential) yields, as reflected in the values of the immature lower hot shale in the shallow borehole BG-14 in the Southern Desert outcrop area and exploration well Hunt JF-1 in the Jafr area. Identification and isopach mapping of the lower hot shale is based on its characteristic uranium enrichment. The gamma-ray/total organic carbon correlation coefficient increases with increasing maturity, suggesting that uranium is less vulnerable to maturity effects than the organic matter itself. The gamma-ray log, therefore, can be used as a proxy for the prematuration organic richness, representing a suitable basis for cross-basin comparisons of original organic richness trends. A two-phase generation of hydrocarbons is interpreted for both the Risha and Wadi Sirhan areas, with the first as a pre-Hercynian phase in the Carboniferous and the second as a less intense generation phase during the Mesozoic to early Tertiary. In contrast, gas generation of the Silurian-sourced giant fields in the central part of the Arabian Peninsula and Iran was restricted to the post-Hercynian. In Jordan, both structural and stratigraphic play concepts are envisaged, including fault, paleohigh, and channel plays. Key elements that need attention in future exploration of the Silurian plays in Jordan are Ordovician reservoir quality and timing of maturation. Poor permeabilities have been reported from wells in both the Risha and Wadi Sirhan areas. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005. The American Association of Petroleum Geologists. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To get a better understanding of controls on reef development through time, we created a comprehensive database on Phanerozoic reefs. The database currently comprises 2470 reefs and contains information about geographic position/paleo-position, age, reef type, dimensions, environmental setting, paleontological and petrographical features, and reservoir quality of each buildup. Reef data were analyzed in two qualitatively different ways. The first type of analysis was by visualization of paleogeographic reef distribution maps. Five examples (Late Devonian, Early Permian, Late Triassic, Late Jurassic, middle Miocene) are presented to show the potential of paleoreef maps for paleogeographic and paleoclimatological reconstructions. The second type of analysis was a numerical processing of coded reef characteristics to realize major trends in reef evolution and properties of reef carbonates. The analysis of paleolatitudinal reef distributions through time shows pronounced asymmetries in some time slices, probably related to climatic asymmetries rather than controlled by plate tectonic evolution alone. The dominance of particular reef builders through time suggests that there are seven cycles of Phanerozoic reef development. First curves for the Phanerozoic distribution of bio-erosion in reefs, bathymetric setting, and debris potential of reefs are presented. The observed pattern in the temporal and spatial distribution of reefs with reservoir quality may assist in hydrocarbon exploration. Statistical tests on the dependencies of reefal reservoir quality suggest that large size, high debris potential, low paleolatitude, high amount of marine aragonite cement, and a platform/shelf edge setting favor reservoir quality. Reefal reservoirs are significantly enhanced in times of high evaporite sedimentation, elevated burial of organic carbon, low oceanic crust production, low atmospheric CO2content, and cool paleoclimate, as well as when they are present in aragonite oceans.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

From this, the question of inversion over time from the former quantity into the latter is then posed using a generalized expression to approximate global subduction zone distribution. Two numerical methods are described. Then, assuming the hypothesis that long-term (108yr) eustatic sealevel change is due primarily to changing ridge volume, an inversion of a widely cited Phanerozoic sealevel curve (Vail) is also presented. The approach taken here is expected to be of direct importance for quantitative models of the carbonate-silicate cycle which seek to develop scenarios for atmospheric carbon dioxide variation over geologic time scales. Indeed, the testing of sealevel inversion, as performed here, may ultimately come from its degree of correspondence with past climate variation.-Author},

abstract = {Premise of the study: The streptophyte water-to-land transition was a pivotal, but poorly understood event in Earth history. While some early-diverging modern streptophyte algae are aeroterrestrial (living in subaerial habitats), aeroterrestrial survival had not been tested for Coleochaete, widely regarded as obligately aquatic and one of the extant green algal genera most closely related to embryophytes. This relationship motivated a comparison of aeroterrestrial Coleochaete to lower Paleozoic microfossils whose relationships have been uncertain. Methods: We tested the ability of two species of the experimentally tractable, complex streptophyte algal genus Coleochaete Br{\'{e}}b. to (1) grow and reproduce when cultivated under conditions that mimic humid subaerial habitats, (2) survive desiccation for some period of time, and (3) produce degradation-resistant remains comparable to enigmatic Cambrian microfossils. Key results: When grown on mineral agar media or on quartz sand, both species displayed bodies structurally distinct from those expressed in aquatic habitats. Aeroterrestrial Coleochaete occurred as hairless, multistratose, hemispherical bodies having unistratose lobes or irregular clusters of cells with thick, layered, and chemically resistant walls that resemble certain enigmatic lower Paleozoic microfossils. Whether grown under humid conditions or air-dried for a week, then exposed to liquid water, aeroterrestrial Coleochaete produced typical asexual zoospores and germlings. Cells that had been air-dried for periods up to several months maintained their integrity and green pigmentation. Conclusions: Features of modern aeroterrestrial Coleochaete suggest that ancient complex streptophyte algae could grow and reproduce in moist subaerial habitats, persist through periods of desiccation, and leave behind distinctive microfossil remains. {\textcopyright} 2012 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract = {Extensive organic-matter (OM) rich facies (black shales) occur in the Ordo-Silurian boundary successions in the Yangtze area, South China. To investigate the redox changes of the Yangtze Sea during the Ordo-Silurian transition, two OM sections (Wangjiawan in Yichang, Hubei Province, and Sanjiaguan in Zhangjiajie, Hunan Province) straddling the Ordo-Silurian boundary are studied. The measurements finished in this study include contents of the total organic carbon (TOC), pyrite sulphur, and different species of Fe, including dithionite-extractable Fe (FeD), pyrite Fe (Fep), HCI-extractable Fe (Fed, and total Fe (Fed, in black shales, as well as other redox proxies, such as the S/C ratio, the ratio between highly reactive Fe (FeHR = FeD + Fep) and FeT, and the Fep/(Fep + FeH) ratio, known as the degree of pyritization (DOP). In the Wangjiawan section, the Middle Ashgill sediments have high FeHR/FeT ratios (0.20-0.77; avg. 0.459, high DOP values (0.21-0.72; avg. 0.54), and a relatively constant sulfur content independent of the organic carbon content. By the contrast, the mid-early Hirnantian deposits generally have low FedFeT ratios (0.10-0.35; avg. 0.21), low DOP values (0.11- 0.40; avg. 0.28), and S/C values are clustering on the normal marine value (S/C = 0.36). The late Hirnantian and early Rhuddanian deposits, similar to those of the Middle Ashgill deposits, are characterized by high Fem/FeT ratios (0.32-0.49; avg. 0.41), high DOP values (0.46-0.68; avg. 0.53) and fairly constant sulfur contents. These data suggest the occurrences of marine anoxia on the Yangtze Sea shelf during intervals of the Mid Ashgill, Late Hirnantian and Early Rhuddanian, and ventilated and oxygenated marine conditions during the mid-early Hirnantian time. The mid-early Hirnantian ventilated event was concomitant with the global glacial period, likely resulted from the glacio-eustatic sea-level fall and subsequent circulation of cold, dense oxygenated waters upon the shelf seabed. Accordingly, the abrupt change from oxygenated to anoxic marine waters from the late Hirnantian and the early Rhuddanian were resulted from the post-glacial rise of eustatic sea level. Combined with the data from Sanjiaguan section near the subemergent highland, salinity stratification of water columns are strongly evidenced by very low sic ratios ( 0.0$\sim$.08, avg. 0.02), low FeHR/FeT ratios (0.10-0.37, avg. 0.27), low DOP values (0.01-0.27, avg. 0.10), and TOC contents (0.72%4.27%, avg. 2.55%). Under this circumstance, the anoxic water columns could have formed beneath the halocline, above which desalinized waters formed. In the Wandiawan section, TOC contents are generally high (0.94 9.32%, avg. 4.44%), but low (0.35%-2.12%, avg. 1.29%) in the mid-early Hirnantian that is coincident with the oceanic oxic stage, together with relation of the organic contents to the stratal thickness, suggesting that the accumulation of the organic matter was mainly controlled by the oxygen levels of the water columns; on the other hand, productivity and depositional rate may also have played a role in the organic accumulation and preservation.},

abstract = {Premise of the study: Land plants play an essential role in the evolution of terrestrial life. Their time of origin and diversification is fundamental to understanding the evolution of life on land. We investigated the timing and the rate of molecular evolution of land plants, evaluating the effects of different types of molecular data, including temporal information from fossils, and using different molecular clock methods. Methods: Ages and absolute rates were estimated independently with two substitutionally different data sets: a highly conserved 4-gene data set and matK, a fast-evolving gene. The vascular plant backbone and the crown nodes of all major lineages were calibrated with fossil-derived ages. Dates and absolute rates were estimated while including or excluding the calibrations and using two relaxed clocks that differ in their implementation of temporal autocorrelation. Key results: Land plants diverged from streptophyte alga 912 (870-962) million years ago (Mya) but diversified into living lineages 475 (471-480) Mya. Ages estimated for all major land-plant lineages agree with their fossil record, except for angiosperms. Different genes estimated very similar ages and correlated absolute rates across the tree. Excluding calibrations resulted in the greatest age differences. Different relaxed clocks provided similar ages, but different and uncorrelated absolute rates. Conclusions: Whole-genome rate accelerations or decelerations may underlie the similar ages and correlated absolute rates estimated with different genes. We suggest that pronounced substitution rate changes around the angiosperm crown node may represent a challenge for relaxed clocks to model adequately. {\textcopyright} 2013 Botanical Society of America.},

Several brachiopod species with short stratigraphic ranges, well-known in south-western Europe, allow a precise chronostratigraphic control of a succession that displays important lateral lithological and facies changes, when compared with the type sections in the Central Anti-Atlas. They have also permitted a better consensus between the macrofauna-determined age and that based on micropaleontological analyses. For the first time, the occurrence of a Hirnantia Fauna within the microconglomeratic shales of the Upper Formation of the Second Bani Group is reported.

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to quantitatively investigate the spatial and temporal biogeographical relationships of the recovery of ammonoid faunas after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction using three complementary numerical approaches among which is a new, non-hierarchical clustering strategy. The faunal data set consists of a taxonomically homogenised compilation of the spatial and temporal occurrences of ammonoid genera within 20 Early Triassic Tethyan and Panthalassic sites ranging from 40°S to 70°N in palaeolatitudes. In addition to hierarchical cluster analysis (hCA) and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), we introduce a third, new non-hierarchical clustering technique allowing the visualisation of a nonmetric interassemblages similarity structure as a connected network constructed without inferring additional internal nodes. The resulting network, which we call a "Bootstrapped Spanning Network" (BSN), allows the simultaneous identification of partially or totally nested as well as gradational linear or reticulated biogeographical structures. The identified interlocalities relationships indicate that the very beginning of the Early Triassic (Griesbachian) corresponds to a very simple biogeographical context, representing a time of great cosmopolitanism for ammonoids. This context shifts rapidly to a more complex configuration indicative of a more endemic and latitudinally-restricted distribution of the ammonoids during the middle and late Early Triassic (Smithian and Spathian). From an evolutionary dynamic point of view, our results illustrate a very rapid (less than ca. 1.4 myr) Early Triassic recovery of the ammonoid faunas, in contrast to many other marine organisms. This recovery is linked with a marked increase in the overall biogeographical heterogeneity, and parallels the formation of a latitudinal gradient of taxonomic richness, which may be essentially controlled by the progressive intensification of the gradient of sea surface temperature. From a methodological point of view, we show that a BSN is a simple, intuitively legible picture of the nested as well as gradational taxonomic similarity relationships, hence providing a good synthesis (and additional insights) between hierarchical clustering and ordination in reduced space results. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {The Arabian Plate has experienced a complex tectonic history while also being widely influenced by eustatic sea-level changes. These diastrophic events either affected changes in the rate and/or location of subsidence that in turn led to the creation of significant new sedimentary accommodation, or caused major erosional hiatuses. As a result, both eustasy and tectonics have played important roles in the development of sedimentary sequences and in determining the locus and characteristics of reservoir, source and seal facies on the Arabian Platform. Here, we present a synthesis (Cycle Chart) of the regional sea-level fluctuations affecting the Platform that is based on Phanerozoic epi- and peri-Platform sequence-stratigraphic data. Information used for the synthesis includes sections from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Greater Gulf area, Oman and Yemen. The regional Cycle Chart incorporates interpreted sedimentary onlap patterns on the margins of the Arabian Platform, as well as models of regional sea-level fluctuations that controlled these patterns. These are compared to eustatic data that represents the global-mean models of sea-level changes, largely at second-order cycle level for the Paleozoic and third-order cycle level for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. The comparisons reveal that Phanerozoic sediment accumulation patterns on the Platform were broadly controlled by eustasy, with a strong overprint of tectonics for several long intervals. During periods of tectonic quiescence, however, correlations with the eustatic events improve significantly. Thus, for example, during the Cambrian through early Silurian and mid Jurassic through early Paleogene intervals eustasy may have been the significant controlling factor for sedimentary patterns when long-term trends in both regional and global sea-level curves show similarities. The use of the Cycle Chart could facilitate exploration efforts on the Arabian Platform, provide better chronostratigraphic estimates and global correlations, and prove a useful accompaniment for sequence-stratigraphic studies. This integrative effort was greatly facilitated by the recent publication of the sequence stratigraphic synthesis of the Arabian Plate. The ages of Maximum Flooding Surfaces, however, have been recalibrated to the new (GTS 2004) time scale. This synthesis also represents a new recalibration of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eustatic curves of Haq et al. (1988) to an up-to-date numerical time scale (GTS 2004).},

abstract = {Zooplankton are the intermediate trophic level between phytoplankton and fish, and are an important component of carbon and nutrient cycles, accounting for a large proportion of the energy transfer to pelagic fishes and the deep ocean. Given zooplankton's importance, models need to adequately represent zooplankton dynamics. A major obstacle, though, is the lack of model assessment. Here we try and stimulate the assessment of zooplankton in models by filling three gaps. The first is that many zooplankton observationalists are unfamiliar with the biogeochemical, ecosystem, size-based and individual-based models that have zooplankton functional groups, so we describe their primary uses and how each typically represents zooplankton. The second gap is that many modelers are unaware of the zooplankton data that are available, and are unaccustomed to the different zooplankton sampling systems, so we describe the main sampling platforms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses for model assessment. Filling these gaps in our understanding of models and observations provides the necessary context to address the last gap-a blueprint for model assessment of zooplankton. We detail two ways that zooplankton biomass/abundance observations can be used to assess models: data wrangling that transforms observations to be more similar to model output; and observation models that transform model outputs to be more like observations. We hope that this review will encourage greater assessment of zooplankton in models and ultimately improve the representation of their dynamics.},

In this basin, anastomosing, potentially sand-filled palaeovalley networks within the Upper Ordovician succession have been described from seismic data that provide promising prospects for exploration. However, little is known about the origin and architecture of the palaeovalley-fills. On the Gargaf Arch, an outcrop analogue for these structures occurs and is comparable in scale to the valley networks described in the subsurface. This palaeovalley system is 30 km long with two 4 km-wide tributaries, cut into ice-distal glaciomarine mudrocks and diamictites and filled with ice-proximal sandstones and subordinate shales. It was created by subglacial meltwater erosion and glacial loading of a soft substrate during ice sheet advance. The initial stage of valley-fill involved the deposition of coarse-grained sands and conglomeratic ice-proximal, submarine outwash, as localised mass flows. The main stage of fill was characterised by axially (northerly) prograding, underflow-dominated fan lobes deposited in water depths of up to 80 m. A comparison with coeval valley systems in Mauritania, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Jordan is provided that highlights the variable regional character of palaeovalley-fills and the influence that water-depth had on architecture.},

abstract = {A carbon and sulfur isotope mass balance model has been constructed for calculating the variation of atmospheric O2 over Phanerozoic time. In order to obtain realistic O2 levels, rapid sediment recycling and O2-dependent isotope fractionation have been employed by the modelling. The dependence of isotope fractionation on O2 is based, for carbon, on the results of laboratory photosynthesis experiments and, for sulfur, on the observed relation between oxidation/reduction recycling and S-isotope fractionation during early diagenetic pyrite formation. The range of fractionations used in the modeling agree with measurements of Phanerozoic sediments by others. Results, derived from extensive sensitivity analysis, suggest that there was a positive excursion of O2 to levels as high as 35% during the Permo-Carboniferous. High O2 at this time agrees with independent modeling, based on the abundances of organic matter and pyrite in sediments, and with the occurrence of giant insects during this period. The cause of the excursion is believed to be the rise of vascular land plants and the consequent increased production of O2 by the burial in sediments of lignin-rich organic matter that was resistant to biological decomposition.

abstract = {The first and possibly only major rise of atmospheric oxygen, from po2 ≤ 0.1% PAL (the present atmospheric level) to po2 ≥ 10% PAL, appears to have occured sometime before 2 Ga ago, although the exact time of and the cause(s) for the rise have been hotly debated. Equally important questions on the atmospheric oxygen concern its stability, especially the mechanisms regulating the atmospheric po2 level and the causes and magnitude of po2 variations since the first major rise of atmospheric oxygen. Previous efforts to model the po2 variation during the Phanerozoic time have typically relied on secondary information, such as the carbon and sulfur isotopic records of sedimentary rocks, and on simple dynamics of the geochemical cycles of O,C, S, and P based on box-type models. As a result, many kinetic questions about the variation and stability of atmospheric oxygen could not have been answered. Here we quantitatively evaluate the dynamics and stability of atmospheric O2 and CO2 using recent experimental data, field observations, and a new model for the C-O coupled geochemical cycles. We examine the change with time in the fluxes of various compounds (O2, CO2, phosphate, organic C, carbonate C, C-bearing reduced volcanic gases, and C-free reduced volcanic gases) among the various reservoirs (atmosphere, soil, surface ocean, deep ocean, the lower crust and mantle, and upper crust) under a variety of scenarios. Our model does not assume steady-state fluxes for any of the reservoirs. Rather, the model incorporates the kinetic experimental data on oxidation of coal, a proxy for kerogen, the dynamics of soil formation and erosion, the kinetics of decomposition of organic matter in the Oceans by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, the equilibrium ocean-atmosphere carbonate model, the observed relationships among the organic burial flux, dissolved O2 content of deep ocean, and sedimentation rates, and the three-box model ocean. The important parameters that strongly influence the dynamics of atmospheric O2, are found to be (a) the total area of soil formation on Earth; (b) the average soil depth; (c) the average rate of physical erosion of soils, which is linked to the average rate of accumulation of clastic sediments in the oceans; (d) the composition and flux of volcanic gas; and (e) the level of atmospheric CO2. We develop kinetic equations linking these parameters to the production and consumption fluxes of atmospheric oxygen and also to stable po2 values. Considering the likely ranges of variations in these parameters in geologic history, we suggest that the atmospheric po2 level is likely to have stayed within a very narrow range of 0.6-2 PAL and that the entire ocean, except for local euxinic basins, is likely to have been basically oxygenated since the first major rise of atmospheric oxygen more than 2 Ga ago.

abstract = {One hundred and fifty-six 87Sr/86Sr ratios were measured from Ordovician and Silurian brachiopod shells, marine calcite cements, and conodonts in order to establish the secular strontium isotope curve for the coeval seawater. Preservation of the brachiopod shell material has been evaluated by petrographic and geochemical criteria and only the well preserved internal secondary layer of the shells has been utilized for strontium isotope measurements. The results document a gradual decrease in 87Sr/86Sr, from 0.7091 to 0.7087, from Tremadoc to Llandeilo, a sharp decline to 0.7078 during the late Llandeilo-early Caradoc; little change during Caradoc and the Ashgil; and a steady rise to 0.7087 through Silurian. These long-term (107 yr) variations, with magnitudes in the range of 10-3, are interpreted to be controlled primarily by continental collisional tectonics and its associated erosion and weathering. The gradual decrease in 87Sr/86Sr ratio during the Early Ordovician may record the reduction in uplift and weathering rates due to waning of the Pan-African orogenies. The rapid decline near the Llandeilo/Caradoc boundary suggests a strong hydrothermal flux likely due to increased sea-floor spreading and a possible superplume event. The latter may have caused the prominent transgressive phase, the largestin the Phanerozoic, which would have muted continental flux input. Although the Caradoc was the main interval for the Taconic Orogeny, its impact on the Sr continental flux may have delayed until the early Llandovery. This effect, complemented by reworking of glacial deposits near the Ordovician-Silurian boundary and enhanced by phases of the Silurian Salinic Orogeny, may have combined to give the progressive increase in the strontium isotope ratio through the Silurian. The scale and directionality of these changes makes the strontium isotope curve valuable for dating and correlation purposes.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotope compositions of Silurian calcitic brachiopod shells from Gotland are compared with those of phosphatic inarticulate brachiopod shells and conodonts from identical stratigraphic horizons. The $\delta$ 18 O(phosphate) values of inarticulate brachiopod shells vary widely (13.0 to 17.5‰ V-SMOW) and are significantly lower than those of coeval conodont samples (17.5 to 19.5‰ V-SMOW). Conodont samples from individual beds have homogenous $\delta$ 18 O(phosphate) values with variations close to the analytical precision (±0.2‰). Together with a significant correlation of conodont $\delta$ 18 O(phosphate) and articulate brachiopod shell $\delta$ 18 O(carbonate) values (r = 0.85), this observation suggests that primary marine oxygen isotope compositions are better preserved in conodont apatite than in inarticulate brachiopod shell apatite. However, with decreasing $\delta$ 18 O(carbonate) values, the $\delta$ 18 O(phosphate) values of conodonts are higher than expected for theoretical isotopic equilibrium with brachiopod calcite. Different habitats of conodonts and brachiopods cannot account for the observed offset in $\delta$ 18 O because both organisms were thriving on a broad shallow marine carbonate platform. Whereas $\delta$ 18 O(phosphate) values of Silurian conodonts are close to $\delta$ 18 O(phosphate) values of modern and Mesozoic tropical biogenic apatites, most Silurian calcitic brachiopod shells from Gotland are depleted in 18 O when compared to modern or Mesozoic brachiopods. We therefore suggest that Silurian conodonts from Gotland record paleotemperature and $\delta$ 18 O of Silurian sea water more faithfully than coeval calcitic brachiopod shells.

abstract = {Plate tectonic processes play a critical role in the origin and distribution of sedimentary carbonates through Phanerozoic time. The Phanerozoic age distribution of sedimentary properties like calcite/ dolomite ratio, inferred o{\"{o}}id and cement mineralogy, and survival rate of continental carbonates is cyclic. The cycles appear to be coupled to plate tectonic processes that give rise to global sea level change and changes in the properties of the ocean-atmosphere system. First-order changes in sea level are driven by the accretion of mid-ocean ridges: high accretion rate, high sea level; low accretion rate, low sea level. Although correlations between sea level and sedimentary carbonate properties are not strong, high sea level over an extended period of time appears to be correlated with low calcite/dolomite ratios, lack of inferred aragonite o{\"{o}}ids and cements, and maxima in the survival rate of continental carbonates. The opposite is true for extended periods of low mid-ocean ridge accretion rates and global sea levels. The lack of strong correlations may reflect an insufficient data base and the possibility of lags between sea level change and change in carbonate properties. Furthermore, the survival rate of continental carbonates appears to be affected by differential cycling and, therefore, may not be directly related to accumulation rate. It appears that the environmental conditions for early dolomitization and calcite o{\"{o}}id and cement formation are best met during extended times of high sea level when atmospheric CO2 levels are high and the saturation state of seawater with respect to carbonate minerals relatively low. During low sea levels, early dolomitization is less favored, and aragonite precipitates are more abundant because of low atmospheric CO2 levels and enhanced seawater carbonate saturation states. Differential cycling has modified the Phanerozoic sedimentary carbonate mass-age distribution. Because of erosion of younger units within continental carbonate cycles, it may be difficult to derive an unequivocal record of the partitioning of carbonate between the deep-sea and shallow-water realms of deposition during the Phanerozoic. This difficulty must be considered in further quantification of geochemical models describing the geologic history of atmospheric CO2 and climate change. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Ratios of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in brachiopod shells (more than 370 specimens, esp. Atrypa reticularis) from the Silurian of Gotland, Sweden, have been analysed. Preservation of biological skeletal ultrastructures, observed in SEM-micrographs, and cathodoluminescence analyses indicate that usually no diagenetical alteration occurs. The Silurian of Gotland consists of 440 m carbonate deposits, spanning the late Llandovery to late Ludlow epochs (431-411 m.y.). Repeatedly, uniform sequences of micritic limestones and marls are interrupted by complex-structured reefs and adjacent platform sediments. Previously, the alternation of facies is interpreted as the result of sea level fluctuations caused by a gradual regression with superimposed minor transgressive pulses. The Silurian sequence of Gotland exhibits principally parallel carbon and oxygen isotope records corresponding closely to the topostratigraphic units. Lower values occur in periods dominated by deposition of marly sequences. Higher values are observed in periods dominated by reefs and extended carbonate platforms. The isotope ratios are influenced by local as well as global factors. The oxygen isotope ratios are interpreted to reflect paleosalinity changes due to varying freshwater input, rather than changes in paleotemperature. Consequently, the facies distribution of Gotland is interpreted as resulting from changes in terrigenous input caused by different rates of continental weathering and freshwater runoff rather than by sea level fluctuations. Periods of arid climate and, therefore, anti-estuarine downwelling of oxygenated surface water appear as short episodes of reef growing (≤1.5 m.y.) in an epoche characterized by a tropic humid climate, which causes an estuarine circulation and the upwelling of CO2-rich deep water. Carbon isotope ratios are obviously connected to these changes in circulation by the advection of 13C-rich surface water (arid episodes) or upwelling of 13C-depleted deep water (humid episodes) of a Silurian ocean which itself reveals generally euxinic deep water conditions due to the burial of organic carbon in black shales.

We show here that the opening or closing of an Arctic-Pacific marine gateway induces transitions between different equilibrium states of the thermohaline circulation. Sensitivity tests of the inferred modes of thermohaline circulation to atmospheric CO2 level changes have also been explored. An abrupt switch in deep convection from high northern to high southern latitudes, a change consistent with isotopic evidences, is reproduced by our simulations. The switch is caused by a combination of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and inflow in the North Pacific of low-salinity Arctic waters when the Arctic-Pacific marine gateway is opened. The state of the gateway (open/closed) may have changed rapidly through variations in sea level that have been inferred for the Maastrichtian period.

abstract = {Pluridisciplinary fieldwork highlights features generated by an extended ice-sheet in the Djado Basin during the Himantian. Two glacial palaeovalley systems associated with glacial pavements and separated by thin glaciomarine interstadial series are revealed. Rigid glacial pavements characterised by abrasion erosion are differentiated from soft glacial pavements characterised by soft-bed deformation. Glacial pavements are associated with subglacial bedforms such as megaflutes, flutes and meltwater channels. They are also associated with clastic dykes and glaciotectonic structures such as deformed flutes, subglacial folds and duplex structures. This record demonstrates that ice was warm-based and flowed rapidly on the high-fluid-pressure soft substrate, as for ice streams. The erosional glacial landscape is typical of areal scouring, and the depositional sediment-landform assemblage corresponds to subglacial processes. These data afford a reconstruction of glacial events which is consistent with the two polyphased low-frequency glacial cycles inferred in previous studies. During interstadial and postglacial stages, grabens, normal faults, radial extensional microfaults and extensional dihedrons were generated by extensional tectonics during glacio-isostatic rebound. In sectors highly affected by this tectonics, doleritic dykes reflect a basal crust fusion increase induced by adiabatic decompression. {\textcopyright} 2007 Lavoisier SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Lichens and mosses growing on granitic gneiss in a boreal forest environment caused intense chemical weathering of the rock, producing exclusively biogenic secondary minerals and soils and accumulating solubilised rock-forming elements (Si and metals), but weathering in the absence of these organisms was relatively ineffective. Apart from primary biotite, the only phyllosilicates in the rock were sericite and chlorite formed by hydrothermal metamorphism or abiotic weathering, or both, but the biogenic soils contained expandable clay minerals and, in several cases, kaolinite and calcite, together with illite and chlorite. Lichens were especially effective in altering feldspars to clay, but mosses generally produced a greater abundance of expandable clay minerals, and kaolinite was produced only by certain species of moss - specifically the ones whose rock-derived element concentrations and Mg/Ca ratios were highest. Rock-derived element concentrations were usually highest in mosses, and element enrichment increased with the charge/radius ratio of the cation of the element, suggesting carrier-mediated transport across cell membranes. Furthermore, lichens and mosses produced different assemblages of expandable clay minerals, and most mosses (but none of the lichens) produced authigenic amphiboles and pyroxenes. Biological weathering is attributable to solubilisation of rock-forming elements by chelating agents and H<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf>, bioaccumulation of the elements, and nucleation of secondary silicates by chelate complexes functioning as templates for epitaxial growth of specific crystal structures. The different weathering and soil-forming processes of lichens and mosses suggest a mutualistic strategy for maximising the release of inorganic nutrients from rocks and retaining them in bioavailable forms in the soil.},

abstract = {We measured the He and Ne concentrations of 50 individual extraterrestrial chromite grains recovered from mid-Ordovician (lower Darriwilian) sediments from the Lynna River section near St. Petersburg, Russia. High concentrations of solar wind-like He and Ne found in most grains indicate that they were delivered to Earth as micrometeoritic dust, while their abundance, stratigraphic position and major element composition indicate an origin related to the L chondrite parent body (LCPB) break-up event, 470Ma ago. Compared to sediment-dispersed extraterrestrial chromite (SEC) grains extracted from coeval sediments at other localities, the grains from Lynna River are both highly concentrated and well preserved. As in previous work, in most grains from Lynna River, high concentrations of solar wind-derived He and Ne impede a clear quantification of cosmic-ray produced He and Ne. However, we have found several SEC grains poor in solar wind Ne, showing a resolvable contribution of cosmogenic 21 Ne. This makes it possible, for the first time, to determine robust cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages in these fossil micrometeorites, on the order of a few hundred-thousand years. These ages are similar to the CRE ages measured in chromite grains from cm-sized fossil meteorites recovered from coeval sediments in Sweden. As the CRE ages are shorter than the orbital decay time of grains of this size by Poynting-Robertson drag, this suggests that the grains were delivered to Earth through direct injection into an orbital resonance. We demonstrate how CRE ages of fossil micrometeorites can be used, in principle, to determine sedimentation rates, and to correlate the sediments at Lynna River with the fossil meteorite-bearing sediment layers in Sweden. In some grains with high concentrations of solar wind Ne, we nevertheless find a well-resolved cosmogenic 21 Ne signal. These grains must have been exposed for up to several 10Ma in the regolith layer of the pre-break-up L chondrite parent body. This confirms an earlier suggestion that such regolith grains should be abundant in sediments deposited shortly after the break-up of the LCPB asteroid. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Here we present Sr, C, and O isotope curves for Ordovician marine calcite based on analyses of 206 calcitic brachiopods from 10 localities worldwide. These are the first Ordovician-wide isotope curves that can be placed within the newly emerging global biostratigraphic framework. A total of 182 brachiopods were selected for C and O isotope analysis, and 122 were selected for Sr isotope analysis. Seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr decreased from 0.7090 to 0.7078 during the Ordovician, with a major, quite rapid fall around the Middle-Late Ordovician transition, most probably caused by a combination of low continental erosion rates and increased submarine hydrothermal exchange rates. Mean $\delta$ 18 O values increase from -10‰ to -3‰ through the Ordovician with an additional short-lived increase of 2 to 3‰ during the latest Ordovician due to glaciation. Although diagenetic alteration may have lowered $\delta$ 18 O in some samples,particularly those from the Lower Ordovician, maximum $\delta$ 18 O values, which are less likely to be altered, Increase by more than 3‰ through the Ordovician in both our data and literature data. We consider that this long-term rise in calcite $\delta$ 18 O records the effect of decreasing tropical seawater temperatures across the Middle-Late Ordovician transition superimposed on seawater $\delta$ 18 O that was steadily increasing from ≤-3‰ standard mean ocean water (SMOW). By contrast, $\delta$ 13 C variation seems to have been relatively modest during most of the Ordovician with the exception of the globally documented, but short-lived, latest Ordovician $\delta$ 13 C excursion up to +7‰. Nevertheless, an underlying trend in mean $\delta$ 13 C can be discerned, changing from moderately negative values in the Early Ordovician to moderately positive values by the latest Ordovician. These new isotopic data confirm a major reorganization of ocean chemistry and the surface environment around 465 to 455 Ma. The juxtaposition of the greatest recorded swings in Phanerozoic seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and $\delta$ 18 O at the same time as one of the largest marine transgressions in Phanerozoic Earth history suggests a causal link between tectonic and climatic change, and emphasizes an endogenic control on the O isotope budget during the Early Paleozoic. Better isotopic and biostratigraphic constraints are still required if we are to understand the true significance of these changes. We recommend that future work on Ordovician isotope stratigraphy focus on this outstanding Middle-Late Ordovician event. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {The Fe-Mn oxide fraction leached from deep-sea sediments has been increasingly used to reconstruct the Nd isotope composition of deep water masses, that can be used to track changes in oceanic circulation with a high temporal resolution. Application of this archive to reconstruct the Nd isotope composition of bottom seawater in shallow shelf environments remained however to be tested. Yet as the Nd isotope composition of seawater on continental margins is particularly sensitive to changes in erosional inputs, establishment of neritic seawater Nd isotope evolution around areas of deep water formation would be useful to discriminate the influence of changes in oceanic circulation and in isotopic composition of erosional inputs on the Nd isotope record of deep waters. The purpose of this study is to test the potential of Fe-Mn coatings leached from foraminifera tests to reconstruct the Nd isotope composition of seawater in shelf environments for deep-time intervals. Albian to Turonian samples from two different outcrops have been recovered, from the Paris Basin (Wissant section, northern France) and from the Western Interior Seaway (Hot Spring, South Dakota, USA), that were deposited in epicontinental seas. Rare Earth Element (REE) spectra enriched in middle REEs in the foraminifera leach at Wissant highlight the presence of Fe-Mn oxides. The similarity of the Nd isotopic signal of the Fe-Mn oxide fraction leached from foraminifera tests with that of fish teeth suggests that Fe-Mn oxides coating foraminifera can be good archives of shelf bottom seawater Nd isotopic composition. Inferred bottom shelf water Nd isotope compositions at Wissant range from -8.5 to -9.7 $\epsilon$-units, about 1.5-2 $\epsilon$-units higher than that of the contemporaneous local detrital fraction. At Hot Spring, linear REE spectra characterizing foraminifera leach may point to an absence of authigenic marine Fe-Mn oxide formation in this area during the Late Cenomanian-Early Turonian, consistent with dysoxic to anoxic conditions at Hot Spring, contemporaneous to an Oceanic Anoxic Event. The similarity of the Nd isotopic signal of the carbonate matrix of foraminifera with that of fish teeth suggests that it records the Nd isotope composition of bottom shelf seawater as well. Inferred bottom shelf water Nd isotope compositions at Hot Spring are quite radiogenic, between -7 and -6 $\epsilon$-units, about 2.5-4 $\epsilon$-units higher than that of the contemporaneous local detrital fraction. In contrast, in both sections Fe-Mn oxides leached directly from the decarbonated sediment tend to yield a less radiogenic Nd isotopic composition, typically between 0.2 and 0.8 $\epsilon$-units lower, that is intermediate between that of fish teeth and of the detrital fraction. This suggests the contribution of pre-formed continental Fe-Mn oxides to the Nd isotopic signal, along with authigenic marine oxides, or a detrital contamination during leaching.},

abstract = {An Early Cambrian caliche on the St Non's Formation (emended) is the base of the Caerfai Bay Formation (unit-term changed) at Caerfai Bay, South Wales. Subaerial exposure and the caliche mean the two formations were not genetically related units. The St Non's is an older sand sheet (likely tidalitic, not delta-related) referred to Avalonian depositional sequence (ADS) 2, and the Caerfai Bay is a shallow mud basin unit refered to ADS 4A. The similar Random Formation (upper ADS 2) in North American Avalonia has a basal age of c. 528 Ma and is unconformably overlain by red mudstones or sandstones in fault-bounded basins on the Avalonian inner platform. Coeval British sandstones (lower Hartshill, Wrekin, St Non's, Brand Hills') are unconformably overlain by latest Terreneuvian (ADS 3) or Epoch 2 (ADS 4A) units. Dates of 519 Ma on Caerfai Bay ashes give an upper bracket on the late appearance of Avalonian trilobites and suggest an ADS 2-4A hiatus of several million years. Post-St Non's and post-Random basin reorganization led to abundant Caerfai Bay Formation volcanic ashes and sparse Brigus Formation ashes in Newfoundland. The broad extent of erosional sequence boundaries that bracket lithologically similar to identical units emphasize that 'east' and 'west' Avalonia formed one palaeocontinent. The inner platform in southern Britain was larger than the Midlands craton, a tectonically defined later Palaeozoic area unrelated to terminal Ediacaran - Early Palaeozoic depositional belts. The cool-water successions of Early Palaeozoic Avalonia were distant from coeval West Gondwanan carbonate platforms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Graptoloid evolutionary dynamics show a marked contrast from the Ordovician to the Silurian. Subdued extinction and origination rates during the Ordovician give way, during the late Katian, to rates that were highly volatile and of higher mean value through the Silurian, reflecting the significantly shorter lifespan of Silurian species. These patterns are revealed in high-resolution rate curves derived from the CONOP (constrained optimization) scaled and calibrated global composite sequence of 2094 graptoloid species. The end-Ordovician mass depletion was driven primarily by an elevated extinction rate which lasted for c. 1.2 Ma with two main spikes during the Hirnantian. The early Silurian recovery, although initiated by a peak in origination rate, was maintained by a complex interplay of origination and extinction rates, with both rates rising and falling sharply. The global $\delta$13C curve echoes the graptoloid evolutionary rates pattern; the prominent and well-known positive isotope excursions during the Late Ordovician and Silurian lie on or close to times of sharp decline in graptoloid species richness, commonly associated with extinction rate spikes. The graptoloid and isotope data point to a relatively steady marine environment in the Ordovician with mainly background extinction rates, changing during the Katian to a more volatile climatic regime that prevailed through the Silurian, with several sharp extinction episodes triggered by environmental crises. The correlation of graptoloid species diversity with isotopic ratios was positive in the Ordovician and negative in the Silurian, suggesting different causal linkages. Throughout the history of the graptoloid clade all major depletions in species richness except for one were caused by elevated extinction rate rather than decreased origination rate. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2013.},

abstract = {Mafic flows of the Middle to Upper Ordovician Dunn Point Formation of eastern Canada were deeply weathered under warm and relatively humid conditions before being buried by subsequent flows. In the absence of superior plants, and in the context of relatively low atmospheric carbon levels, the soils developed alkaline groundwater conditions through mineral-water interactions, which resulted in an enhanced mobility of Al relative to Si in most palaeosols of that formation. Although the vegetation cover was volumetrically insignificant compared with that of subsequent geological times, it was apparently producing very efficient chelates, which, for most palaeosols of the succession, generated a well-defined cheluviation pattern for not only Al and Fe, but also and mainly Ti, which is typically immobile in modern soils. The resulting soils developed an Al-Fe-Ti-depleted upper horizon that was enriched in Si, probably through periodic ground saturation. Long-term climatic variations related to orbital cycles are inferred to have accounted for a second type of soil in the succession, which contrasts with the former by showing a Si-depleted and less Al-Fe-Ti-depleted upper horizon. Some soil material was substantially reworked by surface runoff, but such occurrences can be easily differentiated from in situ soil material in terms of texture, structure and composition. A thick overlying rhyolite flow is thought to be responsible for providing abundant K in solution, which was incorporated in the underlying basalt palaeosols as exchangeable cations within a probably montmorillonitic clay precursor to the Fe-Mg-rich phengite that later developed during deep burial and orogenic compression. {\textcopyright} Copyright Cambridge University Press 2011.},

abstract = {Limestone-marl alternations are widespread and typical sediments of epeiric basins and are present in varying abundance throughout the Phanerozoic. In many cases, their rhythmic appearance has been interpreted as a direct response to orbital forcing. However, it is a challenge to unequivocally prove a sedimentary origin of the rhythmic intercalation of the two lithologies. This difficulty arises from differential diagenesis that alters calcareous beds in different ways than interlayers (marls), causing a loss of comparability between the final lithologies. Differential diagenesis, between other effects, causes passive enrichment of the inert non-carbonate fraction in interlayers, where calcium carbonate is dissolved, as well as passive dilution in limestone beds, which get cemented by imported calcium carbonate. Therefore, reliable information about primary systematic differences in the precursor sediments is preserved only in constituents that are not modified during diagenesis. Such diagenetically inert components include the spectra of organic-walled microfossils (but not their absolute concentration in the bulk sediment) and the ratios of certain trace elements (also not their absolute concentrations). Systematic differences in diagenetically inert components can provide unequivocal proof of primary differences. In the limestone-marl alternations, we have studied however, such aspects do not directly reflect the lithological rhythm, shedding doubt on limestone-marl alternations as direct archives of environmental change. Box-model computer simulations visualize possible effects of early diagenetic change acting on the precursors of limestone-marl alternations, independent of the presence or absence of a primary sedimentary rhythm. The simulations demonstrate that diagenesis has the potential to seriously distort any primary rhythm present in the pristine sediment. In particular, differential compaction acting mainly on the marl interlayers induces distortions of the ratios of the original frequencies. These simulations emphasize the difficulties in conducting frequency analyses on relative carbonate contents in real-world successions.},

abstract = {The Ilerdian Stage was created by Hottinger and Schaub in 1960 to accommodate a significant phase in the evolution of larger foraminifera not recorded in the northern European basins, and has since been adopted by most researchers working on shallow marine early Paleogene deposits of the Tethys domain. One of the defining criteria of the stage is a major turnover of larger foraminifera, marked by the FO's of Alveolina vredenburgi (formerly A. cucumiformis) and Nummulites fraasi. There is now conclusive evidence that this turnover was coeval with the onset of the Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE) and, consequently, with the Paleocene-Eocene (P-E) boundary, a temporal correspondence that reinforces the usefulness of the Ilerdian as a chronostratigraphic subdivision of the early Eocene in a regional context. However, in addition to the paleontological criteria, the definition of the Ilerdian was also based on the designation of two reference sections in the southern Pyrenees: Tremp (stratotype) and Campo (parastratotype). In both sections, the base of the stage was placed at the lowest marine bed containing A. vredenburgi specimens. Using the CIE as a correlation tool we demonstrate that these two marine beds occur at different chronological levels, being older in Campo than in Tremp. Further, we show that both beds are in turn younger than the lowest strata with Ilerdian larger foraminifera at the deep-water Ermua section in the Basque Basin (western Pyrenees). Since the age of stage boundaries must be the same everywhere, the choice of these stratotype sections was misleading, since in practice it resulted in the Ilerdian being used as a facies term rather than as a chronostratigraphic unit. To eliminate that conflict, and yet be respectful with established tradition, we propose to redefine the Ilerdian Stage following a procedure similar to the one used by the International Commission on Stratigraphy to establish global chronostratigraphic standards, namely: by using a "silver spike" to be placed in the Tremp section at the base of the Claret Conglomerate, a widespread lithological unit that in the Tremp-Graus Basin coincides with the onset of the CIE. The redefined regional Ilerdian Stage becomes thus directly correlatable to the lower part of the global Ypresian Stage, as currently defined by the International Commission on Stratigraphy. {\textcopyright} UB-ICTJA.},

The nature and timing of the post-extinction recovery and diversification have previously been difficult to assess, due to limited knowledge and preservation of the earliest Silurian faunas. Recent documentation of early Llandovery conodont faunas from a complete stratigraphic succession on Anticosti Island, Qu{\'{e}}bec, along with the data re-examined from earlier detailed studies, provides the basis for a new analysis. Five evolutionary cycles are recognized through the Llandovery, together with a distinct set of bio-events that are interpreted as immigration, emigration, origination, and extinction events through consideration of global occurrence data for Llandovery conodonts. These events are supported by the detailed sampling and stratigraphic range data, as well as the first cladistic analysis of the four key genera: Oulodus, Ozarkodina, Pterospathodus, and Rexroadus. The Anticosti Basin may have been an important centre of evolutionary radiation, given that several genera and species have first appearances in this region and that initial evolutionary lineages can be established for many taxa. Many faunal variations appear to be correlated to eustatic events as well as the changing ocean-climate state through this boundary interval. {\textcopyright} The Geological Society of London 2004.},

abstract = {Carbonate oil reservoirs are sometimes regarded with apprehension in the petroleum industry since it can be difficult to predict the quality of, and ensure high recovery factors from, this rock family. Particular problems are the complex and heterogeneous nature of porosity in carbonate rocks, often leading to large ranges in permeability for any given porosity, and theorganization of carbonate successions most commonly as vertically heterogeneous, but laterallypersistent, layers. Important issues that arise time and again in carbonate reservoir description include (a) predicting reservoir quality at inter-well scales and in uncored wells, (b) recognizing problematic highpermeability layers, (c) determining the permeability component to allocate to fractures and connected vug systems, and (d) populating reservoir models with representative physical parameters. Because porosity in carbonate rocks generally presents as diverse and heterogeneous, conventional core plugs are seldom representative of large rock volumes and significant issues remain in terms of the scale-compatibility of the various datasets for measured physical parameters that are used in carbonate reservoir description. Many of the worldSTS s' largest carbonate reservoirs were discovered and developed shortly after the Second WorldWar and are now showing signs of maturity, expressed variously as poor pressure support, wateror gas breakthrough and stranded resources. The proportion of the world's 'conventional' petroleum that is reservoired in carbonate rocks is commonly estimated at around 50-60% and many large carbonate reservoirs are likely to have a production lifetime beyond 50 years. It is no coincidence then that the petroleum industry has been the primary source of funding of and promotion of research into carbonate rocks and depositional systems, often with impacts extending well beyond oil and gas exploitation. {\textcopyright} The Geological Society of London 2012.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes research on Ordovician to Lochkovian vegetation development in a palaeogeographic framework. A terrestrialization model is described. Palaeogeographic maps are modified to explain the vegetation migrations. Land plants first evolved on the Gondwana plate and colonized Avalonia and later Laurentia and Baltica when those plates were in close proximity (Ashgill-Llandovery). South America was colonized during the Llandovery following the collapse of the ice sheet centred on the southern pole which had previously been an impassable barrier for miospores. An Aeronian-Telychian event related to the global early Silurian transgression modified the vegetation by destroying biotopes where the earliest vegetation was thriving. During the regression, trilete spore-producing plants appear to have been more able to respond to environmental changes and dominated the vegetation from the Homerian. Cryptospore-producing plants could survive under a wide range of climates, which helped them to survive during the Hirnantian glaciation. On the contrary, the earliest trilete spore-producing plants were probably climatically restricted, as suggested by latitudinal variation in assemblage composition. By the end of the Silurian, there were several phytogeographic units. Information on the earliest vegetation favours palaeogeographic reconstructions where plates are in close proximity. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Geological Society of London.},

abstract = {Whether the latitudinal distribution of climate-sensitive lithologies is stable through greenhouse and icehouse regimes remains unclear. Previous studies suggest that the palaeolatitudinal distribution of palaeoclimate indicators, including coals, evaporites, reefs and carbonates, has remained broadly similar since the Permian period, leading to the conclusion that atmospheric and oceanic circulation control their distribution rather than the latitudinal temperature gradient. Here we revisit a global-scale compilation of lithologic indicators of climate, including coals, evaporites and glacial deposits, back to the Devonian period. We test the sensitivity of their latitudinal distributions to the uneven distribution of continental areas through time and to global tectonic models, correct the latitudinal distributions of lithologies for sampling- and continental area-bias, and use statistical methods to fit these distributions with probability density functions and estimate their high-density latitudinal ranges with 50% and 95% confidence intervals. The results suggest that the palaeolatitudinal distributions of lithologies have changed through deep geological time, notably a pronounced poleward shift in the distribution of coals at the beginning of the Permian. The distribution of evaporites indicates a clearly bimodal distribution over the past $\sim$400 Ma, except for Early Devonian, Early Carboniferous, the earliest Permian and Middle and Late Jurassic times. We discuss how the patterns indicated by these lithologies change through time in response to plate motion, orography, evolution and greenhouse/icehouse conditions. This study highlights that combining tectonic reconstructions with a comprehensive lithologic database and novel data analysis approaches provide insights into the nature and causes of shifting climatic zones through deep time.},

abstract = {A thick Ordovician intra-rhyolitic palaeosol was studied to investigate the peculiarities of early Palaeozoic continental environments, shortly before the development of vascular plants, and to compare its pedogenic patterns with those of previously studied intra-basaltic profiles from the same succession. Well-defined K-eluviation from the top of the palaeosol is proportionally met by K-illuviation at the base of the profile, a pedogenic behaviour that was masked in the underlying intra-basaltic profiles due to subsequent eodiagenetic K-enrichment associated with rhyolite emplacement. Greater stability of K (and eventually Mg) than Si in the intra-rhyolitic profile suggests high pH soil water at the time of pedogenesis despite the low base contents of the acidic host rock, and despite evidence for humid weathering conditions. We also observe that, at the base and at the top of the profile, Al2O3/Zr ratios are substantially lower than those of the host rock, suggesting Al-leaching and therefore extreme weathering conditions, whereas the middle portion of the profile shows Al2O3/Zr ratios that are similar to those of the host rock, suggesting Al stability and therefore less extreme conditions. We interpret these variations in Al2O3/Zr ratios as signatures of a cyclic change from sub-humid periods during which Al was stable throughout the profile, to more humid periods with a well-defined seasonality, during which only the juvenile zone of weathering at the base of the profile could have developed sufficiently high pH during dry seasons for Al to be leached, leaving the Al2O3/Zr signatures from previous stages untouched higher in the profile.},

The total amount of carbonate produced in the reef ecosystem in a given time slice is a function of global reef abundance, average reef size and the relative amount of carbonate exported from the reefs. Carbonate production of reefs is usually low, but characterized by prominent peaks in the mid-Silurian Givetian-Frasnian, the Late Triassic, the Late Jurassic, the mid-Cretaceous and the Neogene. The determinants of reefal carbonate production are correlated with a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters such as palaeogeographic setting, dominant biota, reef type, bioerosion, petrographic composition, eustatic sea level, oceanic crust production rates, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, and global nutrient level. The calculated carbonate production, however, is rarely correlated with particular Earth system parameters. This implies that either the controls on reefal carbonate production are too complex to allow reliable predictions, or biotic factors represent more important controls than physico-chemical parameters. The constructed curve of Phanerozoic reefal carbonate export production is also poorly correlated with proposed curves of global shallow-water carbonate production suggesting that reefs rarely contributed in a quantitatively significant way to the global carbonate budget.},

abstract = {The widespread growth of reefs formed by a framework of biogenic constructors and frame-lacking carbonate mounds began on Baltica during Ordovician time. Previously, Ordovician reef and mound development on Baltica was considered to be sporadic and local. A review of all known bioherm localities across the Baltic Basin reveals a more consistent pattern. Ordovician bioherms grew in a wide E-W-aligned belt across the Baltic Basin and occur in several places in Norway. Substantial reef development began simultaneously across the region during the late Sandbian - early Katian interval and climaxed during the late Katian Pirgu age. The current spatiotemporal distribution of bioherms is a result of interdependent factors that involve original drivers of reef development such as relative sea level, climate during the time of deposition and effects of post-depositional erosion. Oceanographic conditions were likely more favourable during times of cooler global climates, low sea level and glacial episodes. At the same time, the likelihood that bioherms are preserved from long-term erosion is higher when deposited during low sea level in deeper parts of the basin. A main factor controlling the timing of the reef and mound evolution was Baltica's shift toward palaeotropical latitudes during Late Ordovician time. The time equivalence between initial reef growth and the Guttenberg isotope carbon excursion (GICE) suggests that global climatic conditions were important.},

The widespread nature of these deposits suggests that they were not strictly controlled by local basin geometry but were a product of ″Oceanic Anoxic Events″ . Interpretation of these events as the result of the interplay of two major geologic and climatic factors is given. The Late Cretaceous transgression which increased the area and volume of shallow epicontinental and marginal seas and was accompanied by an increase in the production of organic carbon; and the existence of an equable global climate which reduced the supply of cold oxygenated bottom water to the world ocean. This combination of climatic and hypsographic conditions favoured the formation of an expanded oxygen-minimum layer and where this intersected the sediment-water interface, organic carbon-rich deposits could be formed, these being records of ″Oceanic Anoxic Events″ .},

abstract = {Pervasive growth of microencrusters (Lithocodium/Bacinella) characterizes shortlived stratigraphic intervals in Lower Aptian shallow-water carbonate platform settings of the central and southern Tethys. Although a causal relationship between this peculiar shallow-water facies and the early Aptian oceanic anoxic event (OAE) 1a seems likely, the temporal and spatial distributions of Lithocodium and Bacinella mass occurrences in the rock record point to a rather complex pattern. Possible controls include various global and regional drivers expressed in environmental perturbation of neritic ecosystems. Microencruster blooms have hitherto been reported to occur at the onset and in the aftermath of OAE 1a, slightly pre- or postdating the deposition of dark organic-rich black shales in pelagic basins. This study presents evidence for a punctuated and well-expressed early Aptian bloom of the ulvophycean green algae Lithocodium aggregatum observed at the proto-North Atlantic margin, Lusitanian Basin, Portugal. Similar to southern and central Tethyan sections, a Lithocodium-dominated interval temporally replaces the rudist-dominated platform ecosystem. This Lithocodium-rich horizon is composed of oncoidal floatstones and boundstones, including a well-exposed biohermal level, and reaches a thickness of up to 6 m. High-resolution carbon-isotope stratigraphy shown here clearly argues for Lithocodium to represent a biotic harbinger of environmental change in the run-up of OAE 1a. Chemo stratig raphy provides evidence that the subsequent carbonate platform breakdown in the proto-North Atlantic was coeval with an early Aptian carbonate platform drowning episode observed in the northern Tethys prior to OAE 1a. A regionally enhanced nutrient level and a relative sealevel rise are suggested to have triggered the transient mass occurrence of Lithocodium microencrusters, which also may have been influenced by elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations related to the emplacement of the Ontong Java large igneous province. Upwelling water masses and enhanced terrigenous runoff due to increased weathering may have served as possible sources of the required nutrients, which tentatively diminished and finally interrupted the metazoan carbonate platform factory. {\textcopyright} 2012 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The early Paleozoic climate has been described as warm and equable. However, recent data based on conodont oxygen isotopic composition reveal a large, long, cooling trend through the Ordovician, followed by an abrupt cooling during the Late Ordovician glaciation. This long-term climate change is associated with a major radiation in the Earth life history. Nonetheless, the driving mechanisms for this cooling trend remain unknown. Carbon dioxide consumption by the weathering of fresh rocks from volcanic arcs has recently been suggested as a possible driver for this climate change. However, the impact of the plate motion context has not been explored yet, although it might have a major impact on atmospheric CO2 levels. Simulations with a climate model coupled to a biogeochemical model (GEOCLIM) show that the atmospheric CO2 decreased from more than 20 PAL ($\sim$5600 ppmv) in the Furongian down to approximately 10 PAL ($\sim$2800 ppmv) in the Llandovery before rising again in the Early Devonian. We suggest that changes in geography and exposure of fresh volcanic rocks on continents are required to explain the large CO2 drawdown that led to the onset of cooler to glacial conditions from the Middle Ordovician to the Llandovery. The weathering of fresh volcanic rocks is itself responsible for 33% of the Late Ordovi-cian atmospheric CO2 decrease; the rest being related to the continent motion through the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Mean annual continental temperature falls by 3°C in the Early Ordovician, reaching 13.5°C during the glacial interval, and rises to 16°C in the Early Devonian. {\textcopyright} 2011 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The Taconic orogeny of eastern North America was not, as traditionally defined, a single orogenic event that occurred at the end of the Ordovician period, but rather a complex series of orogenic episodes or climaxes spread over the larger part of that period. In most sectors of the northern Appalachians it included at least three of the following: disconformity in an external belt where carbonate was accumulating; severe early deformation in an internal volcanic belt; gravity slides from internal uplifts into the external belt; and widespread deformation, especially in the more external belts. In general, these events did not occur at the same time in the various sectors; each took a considerable time, and they overlapped to some extent. The Taconic orogeny also affected the southern Appalachians and may have been the most important one there, but evidence for this assertion is meager and inconclusive. Detailed analysis of the "fine structure" of the Taconic orogeny combats the dogma that orogenies are sharp, discrete events punctuating the geologic record (separating periods and abruptly terminating geosynclinal sedimentation) and suggests instead that they reflect "random-walk" processes within the Earth, in all likelihood the same as those responsible for sea-floor spreading and the present tectonic state of the Earth. {\textcopyright} 1971, The Geological Society of America, Inc.},

However, to a first approximation, stagnation would severely reduce the upwelling supply of nutrients to the photic zone, reducing productivity. Moreover, it is not obvious that ocean stagnation can be achieved. Numerical experiments performed with a three-dimensional global ocean model linked to a biogeochemical model of phosphate and oxygen cycling indicate that a low equator to pole temperature gradient could have produced weak oceanic circulation and widespread anoxia in the Late Permian ocean. We find that polar warming and tropical cooling of sea-surface temperatures cause anoxia throughout the deep ocean as a result of both lower dissolved oxygen in bottom source waters and increased nutrient utilization. Buildup of quantities of H 2 S and CO 2 in the Late Permian ocean sufficient to directly cause a mass extinction, however, would have required large increases in the oceanic nutrient inventory.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotopes measured on Late Ordovician conodonts from Minnesota and Kentucky (United States) were studied to reconstruct the paleotemperature history during late Sandbian to Katian (Mohawkian-Cincinnatian) time. This time interval was characterized by intense volcanism, as shown by the prominent Deicke, Millbrig, and other K-bentonite beds. A prominent carbon isotope excursion (Guttenberg $\delta$13C excursion, GICE) postdates the Millbrig volcanic eruptions, and has been interpreted to reflect a drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide and climatic cooling. The oxygen isotope record in conodont apatite contradicts this earlier interpretation. An increase in $\delta$18O of 1.5‰ (Vienna standard mean ocean water) just above the Deicke K-bentonite suggests an abrupt and short-lived cooling that possibly initiated a first short-term glacial episode well before the major Hirnantian glaciation. The decrease in $\delta$18O immediately after the mega-eruptions indicates warming before the GICE, and no cooling is shown in the GICE interval. The coincidence of the Deicke mega-eruption with a cooling event suggests that this major volcanic event had a profound effect on Late Ordovician (late Mohawkian) climate. {\textcopyright} 2010 Geological Society of America.},

Here we present a bulk-rock and molecular (marine and terrestrial biomarkers) C isotope record at unprecedented time resolution, from the Cismon section of northern Italy, that shows that OAE1a conditions were reached over a period of several thousands of years through a stepwise perturbation of the carbon cycle. The documented sequence of events is most compatible with a trigger associated with increased CO2 emissions, possibly leading to a doubling of pCO2, which in turn caused larger C isotope fractionation in marine and terrestrial organisms, and a major biotic crisis in the calcareous nannoplankton. Our data also show that a release of isotopically light carbon from partial methane hydrate dissociation probably played a minor role in the OAE1a carbon cycle perturbation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Geological Society of America.},

We use a numerical model to explore the hypothesis that volcanic weathering provided the flux of nonradiogenic Sr to the oceans. A close balance between volcanic outgassing and CO2 consumption from weathering produced steady pCO2 levels and climate through the middle Katian, consistent with recent Ordovician paleotemperature estimates. In the late Katian, outgassing was reduced while volcanic weathering continued, and resulted in a cooling episode leading into the well-known end-Ordovician glaciation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {A sedimentary deposit on the continental shelf off Caesarea Maritima, Israel, is identified, dated, and attributed to tsunami waves produced during the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1630-1550 B.C.E.) eruption of Santorini, Greece. The sheet-like deposit was found as a layer as much as 40 cm thick in four cores collected from 10 to 20 m water depths. Particle-size distribution, planar bedding, shell taphoecoensis, dating (radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence, and pottery), and comparison of the horizon to more recent tsunamigenic layers distinguish it from normal storm and typical marine conditions across a wide (>1 km2) lateral area. The presence of this deposit is evidence that tsunami waves from the Santorini eruption radiated throughout the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, affecting the coastal people living there. Dates for the tsunami deposit bracket both the so-called "high" and "low" chronology for the Santorini eruption. In addition to resolving the question of the extent of tsunami impact from the Santorini eruption, the research presented also provides a new means of discovering, identifying, and studying continuous records of paleotsunami deposits in the upper shelf coastal environment. The latter is key to understanding past events, better interpreting sedimentological records, and creating stronger models for understanding tsunami propagation, coastal management, and hazard preparation worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2009 Geological Society of America.},

The majority of Ordovician and Silurian gastropods have openly coiled initial whorls; this morphology was gradually lost. Mesozoic gastropods have exclusively tightly coiled initial whorls. Most protoconchs were formed by planktonic larvae, and this is the first documentation of a supraspecific trend in Paleozoic invertebrate larvae. Open coiling makes shells weak and vulnerable to attack and force. The replacement of weak-shelled plankton by stronger-shelled plankton was probably caused by predatory, selective forces. It coincides with other fundamental changes in plankton communities during the middle and late Paleozoic, including the decline of acritarchs and graptolites. Plankton communities suffered from crises that were probably caused by extrinsic forces. During plankton restructuring in the aftermath, predation could have become an increasingly important selective factor for gastropod larvae.},

abstract = {A coupled climate-geochemical model of new generation (GEOCLIM) is used to investigate the possible causes of the initiation of snowball glaciations during Neoproterozoic times. This model allows the calculation of the partial pressure of atmospheric CO 2 simultaneously with the climate at the continental surface with a rough 2D spatial resolution (10° lat. × 50° long.). We calculate that the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent, starting 800 Myr ago, results in a global climatic cooling of about 8 °C triggered by enhanced consumption of atmospheric CO 2 resulting from increased runoff over continental surfaces. This increase in runoff is driven by the opening of oceanic basins resulting in an increase of soil moisture sources close to continental masses. This climatic effect of the supercontinent breakup is particularly strong within the 800-700 Ma interval since all continents are located in the equatorial area, where temperature and runoff conditions optimize the consumption of CO 2 through weathering processes. However, this effect alone is insufficient to trigger snowball. We propose that the efficient weathering of fresh basaltic surfaces that erupted during the Rodinia breakup, and were transported to the humid equatorial area through continental plate motion, contributed the necessary CO 2 sink that triggered the ca. 730-Ma Sturtian glacial event. Simulations of the GEOCLIM model for the ca 580-Ma Gaskiers ice age, where all continents are centered on the South Pole, shows that no snowball glaciation can be initiated. The calculated CO 2 partial pressure remains above 1000 ppmv, while a threshold of less than 80 ppmv is required to initiate a snowball glaciation. At that time, a polar configuration does not allow the onset of total glaciation. Nevertheless, a regional glaciation is simulated by the GEOCLIM when the climatic and geochemical (i.e. weathering related) effects of the Pan-African orogeny (∼600 Ma) are taken into account. Finally, the question of the role of the paleogeographic setting in the Marinoan snowball event (∼635 Ma) is still an open question, since no reliable Marinoan paleogeographic reconstruction exists due to the paucity of paleomagnetic data. {\textcopyright} 2006 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences.},

abstract = {Part of the uncertainty in predictions by climate models results from limited knowledge of the stability of the thermohaline circulation of the ocean. Here we provide estimates of the response of pre-industrial surface climate variables should the thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic Ocean collapse. For this we have used HadCM3, an ocean-atmosphere general circulation model that is run without flux adjustments. In this model a temporary collapse was forced by applying a strong initial freshening to the top layers of the North Atlantic. In the first five decades after the collapse surface air temperature response is dominated by cooling of much of the Northern Hemisphere (locally up to 8°C, 1-2°C on average) and weak warming of the Southern Hemisphere (locally up to 1°C, 0.2°C on average). Response is strongest around the North Atlantic but significant changes occur over the entire globe and highlight rapid teleconnections. Precipitation is reduced over large parts of the Northern Hemisphere. A southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone over the Atlantic and eastern Pacific creates changes in precipitation that are particularly large in South America and Africa. Colder and drier conditions in much of the Northern Hemisphere reduce soil moisture and net primary productivity of the terrestrial vegetation. This is only partly compensated by more productivity in the Southern Hemisphere. The total global net primary productivity by the vegetation decreases by 5%. It should be noted, however, that in this version of the model the vegetation distribution cannot change, and atmospheric carbon levels are also fixed. After about 100 years the model's thermohaline circulation has largely recovered, and most climatic anomalies disappear.},

abstract = {The CO2 liberated along subduction zones through intrusive/extrusive magmatic activity and the resulting active and diffuse outgassing influences global atmospheric CO2. However, when melts derived from subduction zones intersect buried carbonate platforms, decarbonation reactions may cause the contribution to atmospheric CO2 to be far greater than segments of the active margin that lacks buried carbon-rich rocks and carbonate platforms. This study investigates the contribution of carbonate-intersecting subduction zones (CISZs) to palaeo-atmospheric CO2 levels over the past 410 million years by integrating a plate motion and plate boundary evolution model with carbonate platform development through time. Our model of carbonate platform development has the potential to capture a broader range of degassing mechanisms than approaches that only account for continental arcs. Continuous and cross-wavelet analyses as well as wavelet coherence are used to evaluate trends between the evolving lengths of carbonate-intersecting subduction zones, non-carbonate-intersecting subduction zones and global subduction zones, and are examined for periodic, linked behaviour with the proxy CO2 record between 410Ma and the present. Wavelet analysis reveals significant linked periodic behaviour between 60 and 40Ma, when CISZ lengths are relatively high and are correlated with peaks in palaeo-atmospheric CO2, characterised by a 32-48Myr periodicity and a ∼ 8-12Myr lag of CO2 peaks following CISZ length peaks. The linked behaviour suggests that the relative abundance of CISZs played a role in affecting global climate during the Palaeogene. In the 200-100Ma period, peaks in CISZ lengths align with peaks in palaeo-atmospheric CO2, but CISZ lengths alone cannot be determined as the cause of a warmer Cretaceous-Jurassic climate. Nevertheless, across the majority of the Phanerozoic, feedback mechanisms between the geosphere, atmosphere and biosphere likely played dominant roles in modulating climate. Our modelled subduction zone lengths and carbonate-intersecting subduction zone lengths approximate magmatic activity through time, and can be used as input into fully coupled models of CO2 flux between deep and shallow carbon reservoirs.},

abstract = {The current-climate Indian monsoon is known to boost biological productivity in the Arabian Sea. This paradigm has been extensively used to reconstruct past monsoon variability from palaeo-proxies indicative of changes in surface productivity. Here, we test this paradigm by simulating changes in marine primary productivity for eight contrasted climates from the last glacial-interglacial cycle. We show that there is no straightforward correlation between boreal summer productivity of the Arabian Sea and summer monsoon strength across the different simulated climates. Locally, productivity is fuelled by nutrient supply driven by Ekman dynamics. Upward transport of nutrients is modulated by a combination of alongshore wind stress intensity, which drives coastal upwelling, and by a positive wind stress curl to the west of the jet axis resulting in upward Ekman pumping. To the east of the jet axis there is however a strong downward Ekman pumping due to a negative wind stress curl. Consequently, changes in coastal alongshore stress and/or curl depend on both the jet intensity and position. The jet position is constrained by the Indian summer monsoon pattern, which in turn is influenced by the astronomical parameters and the ice sheet cover. The astronomical parameters are indeed shown to impact wind stress intensity in the Arabian Sea through large-scale changes in the meridional gradient of upper-tropospheric temperature. However, both the astronomical parameters and the ice sheets affect the pattern of wind stress curl through the position of the sea level depression barycentre over the monsoon region (20-150°W, 30°S-60°N). The combined changes in monsoon intensity and pattern lead to some higher glacial productivity during the summer season, in agreement with some palaeo-productivity reconstructions.},

abstract = {During the Archaean, the Sun's luminosity was 18 to 25% lower than the present day. One-dimensional radiative convective models (RCM) generally infer that high concentrations of greenhouse gases (CO<inf>2</inf>, CH4) are required to prevent the early Earth's surface temperature from dropping below the freezing point of liquid water and satisfying the faint young Sun paradox (FYSP, an Earth temperature at least as warm as today). Using a one-dimensional (1-D) model, it was proposed in 2010 that the association of a reduced albedo and less reflective clouds may have been responsible for the maintenance of a warm climate during the Archaean without requiring high concentrations of atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> (pCO<inf>2</inf>). More recently, 3-D climate simulations have been performed using atmospheric general circulation models (AGCM) and Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMIC). These studies were able to solve the FYSP through a large range of carbon dioxide concentrations, from 0.6 bar with an EMIC to several millibars with AGCMs. To better understand this wide range in pCO<inf>2</inf>, we investigated the early Earth climate using an atmospheric GCM coupled to a slab ocean. Our simulations include the ice-albedo feedback and specific Archaean climatic factors such as a faster Earth rotation rate, high atmospheric concentrations of CO<inf>2</inf> and/or CH4, a reduced continental surface, a saltier ocean, and different cloudiness. We estimated full glaciation thresholds for the early Archaean and quantified positive radiative forcing required to solve the FYSP. We also demonstrated why RCM and EMIC tend to overestimate greenhouse gas concentrations required to avoid full glaciations or solve the FYSP. Carbon cycle-climate interplays and conditions for sustaining pCO<inf>2</inf> will be discussed in a companion paper.},

abstract = {In Provence and Languedoc, four drowning events were identified in platform carbonates of late Barremian-Bedoulian age. Their recognition is based on sedimentological and stratigraphical evidence, and their timing, referred to ammonite zones or subzones, is as follows:. (1)Late Barremian, at the G. sartousiana-Imerites giraudi transition, or merely the lowermost part of the I. giraudi zone,(2)Middle Bedoulian, at the Deshayesitesweissi-Deshayesites deshayesi transition,(3)Mid late Bedoulian in correspondence with the "Roloboceras hambrovi subzone" ,(4)Late Bedoulian at the Deshayesites grandis-Deshayesites furcata transition.Corresponding events are also well expressed in basinal settings where they are marked by significant facies and faunal changes.These four successive drowning events distinguish four successive steps in platform development and demise. Step 1 was coeval with the onset of the Bedoulian palaeogeography and started after drowning event (1) with a drastic reduction of shallow platform settings with rudists, usually replaced by Palorbitolina facies. The ensuing recovery of rudist facies and, following drowning event (2), subsequent step 2 marked the developmental phase of the platform system, whereas steps 3 and 4, each prefaced by a drowning event, were associated with its demise. Step 1 represents the major spreading phase of the Urgonian type facies spectrum including bioclastics, coral and rudist facies groups. In Provence, step 1 was characterized by a bipolar (N-S) progradation, and aggradation was coeval with a maximum of subsidence. The termination of step 1 was marked by the emergence of the antecedent platform margin. Step 2, which followed the disappearance of rudist facies and the extreme spatial reduction of both coral and bioclastic facies, started with the flooding of the antecedent platform and the development of Palorbitolina and cherty limestones. Shallow water bioclastics and/or coral facies recovered rapidly on top of the pre-existing emerged areas and developed locally as bioclastic shoals. Step 2 documents a regional reorganisation of subsidence patterns.The infralittoral (high illuminated environments) "Urgonian facies" are therefore essentially present in the Lower Bedoulian, and circalittoral (relatively deep low illuminated environments) deposits dominate in the Upper Bedoulian. This pattern, typical for SE France and wide parts of the Helvetic shelf, departs from that of adjacent regions (e.g. SW France, Spain) where late Bedoulian platform carbonates have a significant record. The record thus shows that the demise of the Urgonian platform was a step-wise phenomenon which cannot be ascribed to a single event, i.e. the Goguel/Selli OAE1a main event. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A comprehensive compilation of literature on global Cretaceous charcoal occurrences shows that from the Valanginian on throughout the Cretaceous, terrestrial sedimentary systems frequently preserve charcoal in abundance. This observation indicates that fires were widespread and frequent and that the Cretaceous can be considered a " high-fire" world. This increased fire activity has been linked to elevated atmospheric oxygen concentrations, predicted as in excess of 21% throughout this period and 25% during some stages. This extensive wildfire activity would have affected the health, composition, and structure of the vegetation and, through habitat loss, probably the fauna. For these reasons, fire activity should be taken into account in Cretaceous vegetation and climate models. Major changes in vegetation occurred during the Cretaceous. In particular, the angiosperms rose to dominance. Some early angiosperms are interpreted as being of weedy form and as having thrived in disturbed environments. Fires may have promoted angiosperm diversification and spread through their role in environmental perturbation. The significant number of charred angiosperm mesofossil assemblages described from the late Early Cretaceous supports this hypothesis. Additionally, it can be speculated that severe fires during the Cretaceous would have engendered increased levels of runoff and erosion leading to the mobilization of significant amounts of phosphorous into marine settings. This phosphorous runoff would have contributed to oceanic planktonic blooms and their associated anoxic events. Fire activity remained prevalent into the Late Cretaceous. New data on the distribution of charcoal in the Campanian of Dinosaur Provincial Park, Canada indicate extensive charcoal deposits over a 1.7 myr interval and suggest that some catastrophic bone bed accumulations may have been the result of post-fire erosion-depositional systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We explore the role of continental drift on the Phanerozoic evolution of the carbon cycle and climate with the GEOCLIM numerical model. GEOCLIM couples a 3D-climate model, a global dynamic vegetation model and a mathematical description of the chemical weathering of the continental surfaces. Twenty-one timeslices covering the whole Phanerozoic are simulated, allowing the calculation of the climate and steady-state atmospheric CO2 for each of these timeslices. We show that continental drift is a first order control parameter of the geological carbon cycle and climate. The salient features are the following: (1) the Paleozoic environment is characterized by a long term CO2 decrease; (2) the Late Permian-Late Triassic period displays very high CO2 levels; (3) atmospheric CO2 is decreasing since the Middle Cretaceous. All these features are driven by the drift of the continents and the subsequent modulation of the water cycle and weathering rates. Furthermore, continental drift imprints the long term evolution of the tropical seawater surface temperatures with periodical oscillations characterized by a frequency of about 120 Myr, in agreement with available data. Finally, we emphasize a discrepancy existing between the climate reconstructions from the most recent apatite $\delta$18O data and the CO2 inferred from proxies. Reconstructed CO2 levels from proxies are often unrealistically low for the distant geological past. {\textcopyright} 2012 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences.},

Sedimentological (facies, sequence stratigraphy) and petrographic analyses combined with natural radioactivity measurement (gamma ray) are carried out. Two facies containing heavy minerals are identified: a shoreface facies and a proximal upper offshore facies. Heavy minerals (mainly titaniferous minerals, zircon and monazite) are concentrated in laminae that can amalgamate to form placers that are several decimetres thick. Their occurrence is highlighted by an increase in the total radioactivity (up to 140,000 cpm) and in the U and Th contents (up to 130 ppm and 800 ppm, respectively). The palaeoplacers are the result of a combination of autocyclic and allocyclic factors.

abstract = {Among the issues raised by the globally ice-covered Earth, or a so-called 'hard' snowball-Earth scenario, one of the most important is to establish the CO2 threshold required for the deglaciation. This problem has been addressed using the Energy-Balance Model (or EBM), which showed that for Neoproterozoic insolation, 0.29  bar of CO2 would be needed to trigger deglaciation. New results, obtained with the Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) FOAM (for Fast Oceanic Atmospheric Model), have demonstrated that, even with an atmospheric content of 0.2 bar, the equatorial temperature remained far below the level required for the deglaciation. Those results show that the cause of deglaciation is unresolved and the discussion about a plausible escape scenario remains open. For this reason, to test and to determine the sensitivity and efficiency of the greenhouse effect during a 'hard' snowball-Earth, we compare the FOAM results with those of LMDz (AGCM of the 'Laboratoire de m{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}orologie dynamique'). The preliminary results show that LMDz is much more sensitive to a CO2 increase than FOAM. This article shows that among processes that could explain this difference, the key factor is the cloud parameterization and its interaction with the convective scheme. These simulations suggest that the CO2 threshold is dependent on the GCM parameterization used, and could be lower than the one suggested by FOAM. Moreover, to investigate other plausible mechanisms able to melt the equatorial ice, we have tested the CH4 impact with a simple 0D model, INCA-ZD. Results show that the balance between the residence times of CH4 in a 'hard' snowball-Earth scenario is largely overcome by the extinction of the organic source, which means that CO2 remains the only greenhouse gas warming the snowball Earth. {\textcopyright} 2006 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences.},

abstract = {Particulate organic carbon fluxes were measured with free-floating particle traps at nine locations during VERTEX and related studies. Examination of these data indicated that there was relatively little spatial variability in open ocean fluxes. To obtain mean rates representative of the oligotrophic environment, flux data from six stations were combined and fitted to a normalized power function, F = F100 (z/100)b; e.g. the open ocean composite C flux in mol m-2 y-1 = 1.53 (z/100-0.858 with depth z in meters. It is shown that the vertical derivative of particulate fluxes may indicate solute regeneration rates, and accordingly regeneration rates for C, H and N were estimated. Oxygen utilization rates were also estimated under the assumption that 1.5, 1.0 and 0.25 moles of O2 were used for each mole of N, C and H regenerated. Regeneration ratios of these elements were depth-dependent: i.e. N:C:H:-O2 = 1.0 N: 6.2 (z/100)0.130 C: 10.0(z/100)0.146 H: [1.5 + 6.2 (z/100)0.130 + 2.5 (z/100)0.146]-O2. Comparisons of our rates with those in the literature indicate that trap-derived new productivities in the open Pacific (≈1.5 mol C m-2 y-1) are substantially less than those estimated from oxygen utilization rates in the Sargasso Sea (≈4 mol C m-2 y-1). A hypothesis is presented which attempts to explain this discrepancy on the basis of the lateral transport and decomposition of slow or non-sinking POC in the Sargasso Sea. Data gathered during the VERTEX studies are also used for various global estimates. Open ocean primary productivities are estimated at 130 g C m-2 y-1 which results in a global open ocean productivity of 42 Gt y-1. Organic C removal from the surface of the ocean via particulate sinking (new production) is on the order of 6 Gt y-1. Fifty percent of this C is regenerated in the upper 300 m of the water column. The ratio of new production (measured with traps) to total primary production (measured via 14C) is 0.14. It is concluded that the 14C technique yields reasonable estimates of primary productivity provided that care is taken to prevent heavy metal contamination. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Once thought to be devoid of life, the Antarctic Ice Sheet is now known to be a dynamic reservoir of organic carbon and metabolically active microbial cells. At the ice-bed interface, subglacial lake and sedimentary environments support low diversity microbial populations, adapted to perennial cold, anoxia and lack of light. The dynamic exchange of water between these shallow environments conveys meltwaters and associated sediments into the coastal ocean. This, together with the release of iceberg-rafted debris to more distal coastal environments, could be important for sustaining primary productivity in the iron-limited Southern Ocean, via the release of associated nutrients and bioavailable iron. We estimate the magnitude and review the wider impacts of the potential export of nutrients (N, P, C, Si and bioavailable Fe) dissolved and associated with suspended sediments in Antarctic runoff and entombed in iceberg rafted debris. Located beneath subglacial lakes and the subglacial till complex are deep sedimentary basins up to 14 km thick, located largely around the Antarctic periphery. These sedimentary basins are largely hydrologically decoupled from shallower lake and till environments by the presence of highly consolidated sediments which limit the penetration of glacial meltwaters to depth. They provide extensive habitats for sustained microbial activity over Ma timescales, and are likely to be a focal point for the anaerobic cycling of organic carbon and other elements in the deep sub-surface. Organic carbon buried in these basins during ice sheet formation is thought to be microbially cycled to methane gas, and the methane largely stored as hydrate within sediments, stabilised by the high pressure/low temperature conditions. We conclude that the export of nutrients and biogenic gases from deep and shallow subglacial Antarctic environments designates Antarctica as a potentially important component of the Earth's carbon cycle, and highlight the importance of evaluating these potential impacts further via global and regional-scale biogeochemical modelling.},

This paper serves in part as a tutorial on the Budyko-Sellers model, with particular focus placed on the coupling of this model with an ice sheet that is allowed to respond to changes in temperature, as introduced in recent work by E. Widiasih. We review known results regarding the dynamics of this coupled model, with both continuous ("Sellers-type") and discontinuous ("Budyko-type") equations. We also introduce two new Budyko-type models that are highly effective in modeling the extreme glacial events of the Neoproterozoic Era. We prove in each case the existence of a stable equilibrium solution for which the ice sheet edge rests in tropical latitudes.

abstract = {The last deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) was associated with major reorganisations in the ocean-climate system and its retreat also represents a valuable analogue for understanding the rates and mechanisms of ice sheet collapse. This paper reviews the characteristics of the LIS at its Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and its subsequent deglaciation, with particular emphasis on the pattern and timing of ice margin recession and the driving mechanisms of retreat. The LIS initiated over the eastern Canadian Arctic $\sim$116-110 ka (MIS 5d), but its growth towards the LGM was highly non-linear and punctuated by several episodes of expansion ($\sim$65 ka: MIS 4) and retreat ($\sim$50-40 ka: MIS 3). It attained its maximum position around 26-25 ka (MIS 2) and existed for several thousand years as an extensive ice sheet with major domes over Keewatin, Foxe Basin and northern Quebec/Labrador. It extended to the edge of the continental shelf at its marine margins and likely stored a sea-level equivalent of around 50 m and with a maximum ice surface $\sim$3,000 m above present sea-level. Retreat from its maximum was triggered by an increase in boreal summer insolation, but areal shrinkage was initially slow and the net surface mass balance was positive, indicating that ice streams likely played an important role in reducing the ice sheet volume, if not its extent, via calving at marine margins. Between $\sim$16 and $\sim$13 ka, the ice sheet margin retreated more rapidly, particularly in the south and west, whereas the north and east underwent only minimal recession. The overall rate of retreat decreased during the Younger Dryas (YD), when several localised readvances occurred. Following the YD, the ice sheet retreated two to five times faster than previously, and this was primarily driven by enhanced surface melting while ice streams reduced in effectiveness. Final deglaciation of the Keewatin and Foxe Domes, left a remnant Labrador Dome that disappeared $\sim$6.7 ka.},

We present here phylogenomic (135 proteins and two ribosomal RNAs, SSU and LSU) and relaxed molecular clock (SSU, LSU, and rpoC1) analyses that identify this interval as a key transition in the marine nitrogen cycle. Specifically, we identify the Cryogenian (850-635 Mya) as heralding the first appearance of both marine planktonic unicellular nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and non-nitrogen-fixing picocyanobacteria (Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus [6]). Our findings are consistent with the existence of open-ocean environmental conditions earlier in the Proterozoic adverse to nitrogen-fixers and their evolution - specifically, insufficient availability of molybdenum and vanadium, elements essential to the production of high-yielding nitrogenases. As these elements became more abundant during the Cryogenian [7, 8], both nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and planktonic picocyanobacteria diversified. The subsequent emergence of a strong biological pump in the ocean implied by our evolutionary reconstruction may help in explaining increased oxygenation of the Earth's surface at this time, as well as tendency for glaciation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Late Aptian–early Albian limestones from the eastern Brazilian continental margin record the early evolution of the South Atlantic Ocean. In Tethyan and North Atlantic domains, a planktic foraminiferal turnover and organic-rich deposits related to Oceanic Anoxic Event 1b (OAE 1b) point to major ocean-climate changes through this interval. Coeval organic-rich deposits of the South Atlantic Ocean have been interpreted as the product of restricted circulation rather than attributed to a global event. However, previous investigations of the early marine phase of South Atlantic lack data from more distal facies, making correlations to global events difficult. Here, we present C, O, and Sr isotopes, elemental geochemistry, TOC and pyrolysis data, as well as a microfacies analysis of an upper Aptian–lower Albian distal section from the Campos Basin (southeastern Brazil). Our focus is on the paleoenvironmental characterization of and the possible association between organic-rich deposits and major perturbations related to Aptian–Albian transition. Five microfacies associations (MA) were identified in the informal units I and III, which were deposited in the neritic region on a carbonate ramp. Organic-rich deposits were described in unit III, composed of planktic-dominated wackestones interbedded with black shales, in a distal dysoxic to anoxic environment. The carbonates 87Sr/86Sr ratios showed a drastic increase (0.7072–0.7074), interpreted as enhanced chemical weathering, supported by the increase of continental input to the top of section. This trend was accompanied by a long-term $\delta$13Ccarb negative excursion, which were assigned to the latest late Aptian–early Albian interval of the isotope reference curves, in accordance with the described occurrence of Colomiella recta. This scenario matches those proposed for the late Aptian–early Albian transition and OAE 1b set, as an enhanced greenhouse stage, pointing to the influence of the referred ocean-climate changes on the deposition of organic-rich deposits of the early South Atlantic Ocean. This investigation gives more evidences that these perturbations were a widespread event, as a product of broad-scale disturbances in the global carbon cycle which also controlled organic deposition and preservation on restricted settings.},

This study evaluates the use of portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) measurements on pelagic carbonates and applies the method to the well-studied latest Maastrichtian in the Bottaccione Gorge section from Gubbio, Italy. A calibration with carbonate reference materials makes it possible to acquire absolute elemental concentrations, and allows for comparison with results from previous geochemical studies, which used more expensive and time consuming conventional techniques, such as neutron activation or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). With adequate measurement strategies and careful calibration, pXRF measurements can be a reliable, non-destructive, cheap, fast and easy to use alternative to acquire multi-elemental concentration data (Ca, Fe, Mn, Sr) in pelagic carbonates. These pXRF elemental concentration data represent valuable additions to classical proxies such as magnetic susceptibility and calcium carbonate content used in the study of pelagic carbonates. Furthermore, the potential of the portable pXRF method for applications in cyclostratigraphical (e.g. using Fe-concentrations) and chemostratigraphical (e.g. using Mn and Sr concentrations) investigations is demonstrated. A strong covariation between the measured Sr concentration profile obtained by pXRF and the existing $\delta$18O record, in combination with micro-XRF mapping, demonstrated the sampling of calcite veins in some of the samples. The first 87Sr/86Sr isotope measurements for the latest Maastrichtian in the Bottaccione Gorge section seem to be little affected by this sampling effect.},

abstract = {As an episode of rapid global warming associated with the release of massive quantities of carbon to the atmosphere and oceans, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, $\sim$56 Ma) is considered a potential analog for modern anthropogenic carbon emissions. However, the prevailing order of magnitude uncertainty in the rate of carbon release during the PETM precludes any straightforward comparison between the paleo-record and the modern. Similar barriers exist to the interpretation of many other carbon isotope excursions in the geological record. Here we use the Earth system model cGENIE to quantify the consequences of differing carbon emissions rates on the isotopic record of different carbon reservoirs. We explore the consequences of a range of emissions scenarios - from durations of carbon input of years to millennia and constant versus pulsed emissions rates, and trace how the isotopic signal is imprinted on the different carbon reservoirs. From this, we identify a characteristic relationship between the difference in carbon isotope excursion sizes between atmospheric CO2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and the duration of carbon emissions. To the extent that available isotopic data spanning the PETM constrain the size of the marine and atmospheric carbon isotopic excursions, applying this empirical relationship suggests the duration of the component of carbon emissions that dominates the isotopic signal could be less than 3000 yr. However, utilizing the ratio of excursion size in the atmosphere to ocean as a metric to constrain duration of carbon emissions highlights the necessity to strengthen estimates for these two measurements across the PETM. Our general interpretive framework could be equally applied in assessing rates of carbon emissions for other geological events.},

abstract = {Profound changes in environmental conditions, particularly atmospheric oxygen levels, are thought to be important drivers of several major biotic events (e.g. mass extinctions and diversifications). The early Paleozoic represents a key interval in the oxygenation of the ocean–atmosphere system and evolution of the biosphere. Global proxies (e.g. carbon ($\delta$13C) and sulfur ($\delta$34S) isotopes) are used to diagnose potential changes in oxygenation and infer causes of environmental change and biotic turnover. The Cambrian–Ordovician contains several trilobite extinctions (some are apparently local, but others are globally correlative) that are attributed to anoxia based on coeval positive $\delta$13C and $\delta$34S excursions. These extinction and excursion events have yet to be coupled with more recently developed proxies thought to be more reflective of local redox conditions in the water column (e.g. I/Ca) to confirm whether these extinctions were associated with oxygen crises over a regional or global scale. Here we examine an Early Ordovician (Tremadocian Stage) extinction event previously interpreted to reflect a continuation of recurrent early Paleozoic anoxic events that expanded into nearshore environments. $\delta$13C, $\delta$34S, and I/Ca trends were measured from three sections in the Great Basin region to test whether I/Ca trends support the notion that anoxia was locally present in the water column along the Laurentian margin. Evidence for anoxia is based on coincident, but not always synchronous, positive $\delta$13C and $\delta$34S excursions (mainly from carbonate-associated sulfate and less so from pyrite data), a 30% extinction of standing generic diversity, and near-zero I/Ca values. Although evidence for local water column anoxia from the I/Ca proxy broadly agrees with intervals of global anoxia inferred from $\delta$13C and $\delta$34S trends, a more complex picture is evident where spatially and temporally variable local trends are superimposed on time-averaged global trends. Stratigraphic sections from the distal and deeper part of the basin (Shingle Pass and Meiklejohn Peak) preserve synchronous global ($\delta$13C and $\delta$34S) and water column (I/Ca) evidence for anoxia, but not at the more proximal section (Ibex, UT). Although geochemical and paleontological evidence point toward anoxia as the driver of this Early Ordovician extinction event, differences between I/Ca and $\delta$13C–$\delta$34S signals suggest regional variation in the timing, extent, and persistence of anoxia.},

abstract = {Land plants invaded continents during the Mid-Paleozoic. Their spreading and diversification have been compared to the Cambrian explosion in terms of intensity and impact on the diversification of life on Earth. Whereas prior studies were focused on the evolution of the root system and its weathering contribution, here we used a coupled climate/carbon/vegetation model to investigate the biophysical impacts of plant colonization on the surface climate through changes in continental albedo, roughness, thermal properties, and potential evaporation. From the Early to the Late Devonian, our model simulates a significant atmospheric CO2 drop from 6300 to 2100ppmv that is due to an increase in the consumption of CO2 though continental silicate weathering. The continental drift and the climatic changes promoted by land plants explain this trend. The simulated CO2 drawdown is paradoxically associated with unchanged temperatures. We show here that the CO2 drop is counteracted by a large warming resulting from the surface albedo reduction caused by the appearance of an extended plant-cover. If CO2 is consensually assumed as the main driver of the Phanerozoic climate, this paper demonstrates that, during land-plant invasion, the modifications of soil properties could have played in the opposite direction of the carbon dioxide fall, hence maintaining warm temperatures during part of the Devonian. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The mid-Pliocene ($\sim$3 to 3.3Ma ago), is a period of sustained global warmth in comparison to the late Quaternary (0 to $\sim$1Ma ago), and has potential to inform predictions of long-term future climate change. However, given that several processes potentially contributed, relatively little is understood about the reasons for the observed warmth, or the associated polar amplification. Here, using a modelling approach and a novel factorisation method, we assess the relative contributions to mid-Pliocene warmth from: elevated CO 2, lowered orography, and vegetation and ice sheet changes. The results show that on a global scale, the largest contributor to mid-Pliocene warmth is elevated CO 2. However, in terms of polar amplification, changes to ice sheets contribute significantly in the Southern Hemisphere, and orographic changes contribute significantly in the Northern Hemisphere. We also carry out an energy balance analysis which indicates that that on a global scale, surface albedo and atmospheric emmissivity changes dominate over cloud changes. We investigate the sensitivity of our results to uncertainties in the prescribed CO 2 and orographic changes, to derive uncertainty ranges for the various contributing processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A sharp increase in deposited sediment volume since Pliocene times has been observed worldwide and in particular around the European Alps. This phenomenon has been linked to a rise in denudation rates controlled by an increase of either climatic or tectonic forcing. Observation of in-situ cooling histories for orogens is critical to assess the reality of the inferred increase in denudation rates, and to determine whether this phenomenon is widespread or localized at active tectonic structures. We exploit the unique density of fission-track ages in the Western European Alps to reconstruct cooling isoage surfaces and to estimate exhumation rates on the orogen scale between 13.5 and 2.5 Ma. Our novel technique is based on the association of isoage contours with age-elevation relationships. It uses map-view interpolation, enabling a spatio-temporal analysis of exhumation rates over the entire Western Alps. The resulting exhumation histories reconstructed for eight areas of the Western Alps display strong similarities in timing and rates with orogen-wide average denudation rates inferred from sediment volumes. This consistency validates the use of both techniques for the study of an orogen characterized by strong relief and high recent exhumation rates. We conclude that exhumation rates in the Western Alps have increased more than twofold since Late Miocene times. This increase may have been locally modulated by the distinct response of different tectonic units. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Carbonates capping Neoproterozoic glacial deposits contain peculiar sedimentological features and geochemical anomalies ascribed to extraordinary environmental conditions in the snowball Earth aftermath. It is commonly assumed that post-snowball climate dominated by CO2 partial pressures several hundred times greater than modern levels, would be characterized by extreme temperatures, a vigorous hydrological cycle, and associated high continental weathering rates. However, the climate in the aftermath of a global glaciation has never been rigorously modelled. Here, we use a hierarchy of numerical models, from an atmospheric general circulation model to a mechanistic model describing continental weathering processes, to explore characteristics of the Earth system during the supergreenhouse climate following a snowball glaciation. These models suggest that the hydrological cycle intensifies only moderately in response to the elevated greenhouse. Indeed, constraints imposed by the surface energy budget sharply limit global mean evaporation once the temperature has warmed sufficiently that the evaporation approaches the total absorbed solar radiation. Even at 400 times the present day pressure of atmospheric CO2, continental runoff is only 1.2 times the modern runoff. Under these conditions and accounting for the grinding of the continental surface by the ice sheet during the snowball event, the simulated maximum discharge of dissolved elements from continental weathering into the ocean is approximately 10 times greater than the modern flux. Consequently, it takes millions of years for the silicate weathering cycle to reduce post-snowball CO2 levels to background Neoproterozoic levels. Regarding the origin of the cap dolostones, we show that continental weathering alone does not supply enough cations during the snowball melting phase to account for their observed volume. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We developed a plate tectonic model for the Paleozoic and Mesozoic (Ordovician to Cretaceous) integrating dynamic plate boundaries, plate buoyancy, ocean spreading rates and major tectonic and magmatic events. Plates were constructed through time by adding/removing oceanic material, symbolized by synthetic isochrons, to major continents and terranes. Driving forces like slab pull and slab buoyancy were used to constrain the evolution of paleo-oceanic domains. This approach offers good control of sea-floor spreading and plate kinematics. This new method represents a distinct departure from classical continental drift reconstructions, which are not constrained, due to the lack of plate boundaries. This model allows a more comprehensive analysis of the development of the Tethyan realm in space and time. In particular, the relationship between the Variscan and the Cimmerian cycles in the Mediterranean-Alpine realm is clearly illustrated by numerous maps. For the Alpine cycle, the relationship between the Alpides senso stricto and the Tethysides is also explicable in terms of plate tectonic development of the Alpine Tethys-Atlantic domain versus the NeoTethys domain. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The origin of third-order eustatic sequences is reviewed by comparing recent sequence stratigraphic data to the latest, best-constrained astronomical model. Middle Eocene to Holocene icehouse sequences correspond to $\sim$ 1.2 myr obliquity cycles. Constraints from oxygen isotope records highlight the link between "icehouse" sea-level lowerings, sequence boundaries, and $\sim$ 1.2 myr obliquity nodes. Mesozoic greenhouse sequences show some relation with the $\sim$ 2.4 myr eccentricity cycles, suggesting that orbital forcing contribute to sea-level change. We suggest that during the icehouse, large ice sheets associated with significant glacioeustatic changes (>>25. m up to 120. m changes) were mainly governed by obliquity forcing. During icehouse worlds, obliquity forcing was the stongest control on global sea-level and depositional sequences. Additionally, during the Middle Eocene, third-order sequences were glacioeustatically driven in tune with $\sim$ 1.2 myr obliquity cycle, suggesting that the presence of significant ice sheets is earlier than previously supposed (i.e., Early Eocene). In contrast, during greenhouse worlds (e.g., ephemeral, small to medium sized or no ice sheets; 0- $\sim$ 25. m glacioeustatic changes), the expression of obliquity in the sedimentary record is weak and intermittent. Instead, the eccentricity signature, which is the modulator of climatic precession, is documented. Moreover, we presume that greenhouse sequences on the myr scale are global and hence cannot be caused by regional tectonism (e.g., intraplate stress or mantle "hot blobs"). Instead, the eccentricity link implies a weaker glacioeustatic control because thermoeustasy is too small to explain the sea-level changes. Stratigraphically well-documented fourth-order sequences may be linked to the astronomically stable (strongest amplitude) 405-kyr eccentricity cycle and possibly to $\sim$ 160-200-kyr obliquity modulation cycles, fifth-order sequences to the short ($\sim$ 100-kyr) eccentricity cycles, and finally sixth-order sequences to the fundamental obliquity ($\sim$ 40 kyr) and climatic precession ($\sim$ 20 kyr) cycles. These astronomical cycles could be preserved in the sedimentary record, and have been demonstrated to control sea-level changes. Accordingly, by placing depositional sequence orders into a high-resolution temporal framework (i.e., orbital periodicities), standardization of eustatic sequence hierarchy may be possible. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sequence stratigraphy emphasizes facies relationships and stratal architecture within a chronological framework. Despite its wide use, sequence stratigraphy has yet to be included in any stratigraphic code or guide. This lack of standardization reflects the existence of competing approaches (or models) and confusing or even conflicting terminology. Standardization of sequence stratigraphy requires the definition of the fundamental model-independent concepts, units, bounding surfaces and workflow that outline the foundation of the method. A standardized scheme needs to be sufficiently broad to encompass all possible choices of approach, rather than being limited to a single approach or model. A sequence stratigraphic framework includes genetic units that result from the interplay of accommodation and sedimentation (i.e., forced regressive, lowstand and highstand normal regressive, and transgressive), which are bounded by 'sequence stratigraphic' surfaces. Each genetic unit is defined by specific stratal stacking patterns and bounding surfaces, and consists of a tract of correlatable depositional systems (i.e., a 'systems tract'). The mappability of systems tracts and sequence stratigraphic surfaces depends on depositional setting and the types of data available for analysis. It is this high degree of variability in the precise expression of sequence stratigraphic units and bounding surfaces that requires the adoption of a methodology that is sufficiently flexible that it can accommodate the range of likely expressions. The integration of outcrop, core, well-log and seismic data affords the optimal approach to the application of sequence stratigraphy. Missing insights from one set of data or another may limit the 'resolution' of the sequence stratigraphic interpretation. A standardized workflow of sequence stratigraphic analysis requires the identification of all genetic units and bounding surfaces that can be delineated objectively, at the selected scale of observation, within a stratigraphic section. Construction of this model-independent framework of genetic units and bounding surfaces ensures the success of the sequence stratigraphic method. Beyond this, the interpreter may make model-dependent choices with respect to which set of sequence stratigraphic surfaces should be elevated in importance and be selected as sequence boundaries. In practice, the succession often dictates which set of surfaces are best expressed and hold the greatest utility at defining sequence boundaries and quasi-chronostratigraphic units. The nomenclature of systems tracts and sequence stratigraphic surfaces is also model-dependent to some extent, but a standard set of terms is recommended to facilitate communication between all practitioners. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The large Palaeozoic continent of Laurentia was largely in North America, but included parts of modern Europe. It was independent from late Neoproterozoic times at about 570. Ma until it merged with Avalonia-Baltica in the 430-420. Ma Silurian Caledonide Orogeny, after which it formed the major western sector of the combined Laurussia Supercontinent. Laurussia in turn became part of the even larger Pangea Supercontinent in the Late Carboniferous, as documented by the oblique Laurussia-Gondwana collision seen in the Laurentian sector in the Ouachita Orogeny. Laurentia's margins and the many peri-Laurentian terranes are reviewed. Those parts of northeast Siberia which today form parts of the North America Plate, but were not part of Laurentia or Laurussia in the Palaeozoic, are also reviewed. A revised Apparent Polar Wander Path (APW) for the Laurentian Craton is presented for all of the Palaeozoic. Laurentia was at equatorial palaeolatitudes throughout and rotated little, apart from shortly after its collision with Avalonia-Baltica in the Silurian Caledonide Orogeny; however, in contrast, its position and orientation were much less affected in the Ouachita Orogeny at the time of Pangean assembly. The Laurentian Craton was variably flooded at many times with epeiric seas, which formed optimal numbers of ecological niches which in turn encouraged animal speciation and evolution. A summary is presented of the Palaeozoic geological history of Laurentia and its surrounding areas, and the Laurentian sector of Laurussia during and after its integration within Pangea, together with new palaeogeographical maps from the Cambrian to the end of the Permian. On those maps there are plotted areas of land, shallow shelf, deeper shelf and oceans derived from much pre-existing data, as well as reefs, volcanic and plutonic rocks and some selected faunas and floras.The substantial number of terranes at the margins of the continent through time are briefly reviewed, notably those in Mexico, the Appalachians, and northwestern parts of Europe which were once parts of Laurentia. The many terranes containing Palaeozoic rocks in the northwestern part of the North American Plate, and forming much of the Cordillera in northwest Canada and Alaska as well as northeast Siberia, are itemised: some were peri-Laurentian, some peri-Siberian, and others originally oceanic in the Palaeozoic. The concept of an Arctida Microcontinent is discussed. That microcontinent had originally been postulated as existing from the Neoproterozoic to the Devonian, and to have consisted of the composite Arctic Alaska and the Seward, York and Farewell terranes in Alaska, and the Pearya Terrane of Ellesmere Island, as well as the Chukotka Peninsula, New Siberian Islands, Severnaya Zemlya, northern Taimyr and adjacent areas now in the northeast of modern Siberia. Many parts of that area contain faunas of both Siberian and Laurentian aspect, which are reviewed and analysed. It is concluded that there was a smaller independent continent in the Lower Palaeozoic, which was originally somewhere between Siberia and Laurentia in the Cambrian, but which did not include the New Siberian Islands, Kolyma and Omolon (which were parts of Siberia), Severnaya Zemlya and northern Taimyr (the independent Kara Microcontinent), or the Farewell Terrane (independent until the Mesozoic). The eastern end of that Arctic Alaska-Chukotka Microcontinent docked with northwestern Laurussia (Ellesmerian margin) in the Devonian, but it did not reach its present position within North America until after rotation in the Cretaceous. The Cordilleran terranes of Wrangellia, Alexander and some smaller units are confirmed as having existed as another microcontinent independent from North America until the Mesozoic. However, there appear to be no terranes now in western North America which originated from Baltica. The Pearya Terrane, now forming northern Ellesmere Island, was probably involved in the most northerly sector of the Silurian Caledonide Orogeny. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {At least six glaciations are purported to have affected North Africa and the Middle East region over the last one billion years, including two in the Cryogenian (Neoproterozoic), Hirnantian (Late Ordovician), Silurian, Carboniferous and Early Permian events. The sedimentary record associated with these glaciations, together with the intensity to which each has been investigated, is highly variable. As hydrocarbon exploration proceeds aggressively across the North Africa and Middle East regions, we review the relationship between glaciation and hydrocarbon accumulations. With the exception of Oman, and locally Egypt, which were tectonically active both during the Neoproterozoic and Early Palaeozoic all glaciations took place along an essentially stable passive continental margin. During the Neoproterozoic, two glaciations are recognised, referred to as older and younger Cryogenian glaciations respectively. Both of these Cryogenian events are preserved in Oman; only the younger Cryogenian has been reported in North Africa in Mauritania and Mali at the flanks of the Taoudenni Basin. The process of initial deglaciation in younger Cryogenian glaciations resulted in incision, at least locally producing large-bedrock palaeovalleys in Oman, and the deposition of glacial diamictites, gravels, sandstones and mudstones. As deglaciation progressed "cap carbonates" were deposited, passing vertically into shale with evidence for deposition in an anoxic environment. Hence, younger Cryogenian deglaciation may be associated with hydrocarbon source rock deposits. Hirnantian (Late Ordovician) glaciation was short lived (< 0.5 Myr) and affected intracratonic basins of Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The organisation of the glacial sedimentary record is considered to be controlled at the basin-scale by the location of fast-flowing ice streams active during glacial maxima, and by the processes of meltwater release during glacial recession. In these latter phases, subglacial tunnel valley networks were cut at or near the ice margin. These tunnel valleys were filled in two main phases. The initial phase was characterised by debris flow release, whereas during later phases of ice retreat a range of glaciofluvial, shallow glaciomarine to shelf deposits were laid down, depending on the water depth at the ice front. Production of linear accumulations of sediment, parallel to the ice front, also occurred between tunnel valleys at the grounding line. In Arabia, the geometry of these features may have been influenced by local tectonic uplift. As glaciogenic reservoirs, Hirnantian deposits are already of great economic significance across central North Africa. Therefore, an appreciation of the processes of ice sheet growth and decay provides significant insights into the controls on large-scale heterogeneities within these sediments, and in analogue deposits produced by glaciations of different ages. Deglacial, Early Silurian black shale represents the most important Palaeozoic source rock across the region. Existing models do not adequately explain the temporal and spatial development of anoxia, and hence of black shale/deglacial source rocks. The origins of a palaeotopography previously invoked as the primary driver for this anoxia is allied to a complex configuration of palaeo-ice stream pathways, "underfilled" tunnel valley incisions, glaciotectonic deformation structures and re-activation of older crustal structures during rebound. A putative link with the development of Silurian glaciation in northern Chad is suggested. Silurian glaciation appears to have been restricted to the southern Al Kufrah Basin in the eastern part of North Africa, and was associated with the deposition of boulder beds. Equivalent deposits are lacking in shallow marine deposits in neighbouring outcrop belts. Evidence for Carboniferous-Permian glaciation is tentative in the eastern Sahara (SW Egypt) but well established on the Arabian Peninsula in Oman and more recently in Saudi Arabia. Pennsylvanian-Sakmarian times saw repeated glaciation-deglaciation cycles affecting the region, over a timeframe of about 20 Myr. Repeated phases of deglaciation produced a complex stratigraphy consisting, in part, of structureless sandstone intervals up to 50 m thick. Some of these sandstone intervals are major hydrocarbon intervals in the Omani salt basins. Whilst studies of the Hirnantian glaciation can provide lessons on the causes of large-scale variability within Carboniferous-Permian glaciogenic reservoirs, additional factors also influenced their geometry. These include the effects of topography produced during Hercynian orogenesis and the mobilisation and dissolution of the Precambrian Ara Salt. Deglacial or interglacial lacustrine shale, with abundant palynomorphs, is also important. Whilst both Cryogenian intervals and the Hirnantian-Rhuddanian deglaciation resulted in the deposition of glaciomarine deposits, Carboniferous-Permian deglaciation likely occurred within a lacustrine setting. Hence, compared to shales of other glacial epochs, the source rock potential of Carboniferous-Permian deglacial deposits is minimal. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Lowermost Silurian organic-rich ('hot') shales are the origin of 80-90% of Palaeozoic sourced hydrocarbons in North Africa and also played a major role in petroleum generation on the Arabian Peninsula. In most cases, the shales were deposited directly above upper Ordovician (peri-) glacial sandstones during the initial early Silurian transgression that was a result of the melting of the late Ordovician icecap. Deposition of the main organic-rich shale unit in the North African/Arabian region was restricted to the earliest Silurian Rhuddanian stage (acuminatus, atavus and probably early cyphus graptolite biozones). During this short period (1-2 m.y.), a favourable combination of factors existed which led to the development of exceptionally strong oxygen-deficiency in the area. In most countries of the study area, the post-Rhuddanian Silurian shales are organically lean and have not contributed to petroleum generation. The distribution and thickness of the basal Silurian 'hot' shales have been mapped in detail for the whole North African region, using logs from some 300 exploration wells in Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. In addition, all relevant, accessible published and unpublished surface and subsurface data of the lower Silurian shales in North Africa and Arabia have been reviewed, including sedimentological, biostratigraphic and organic geochemical data. The lowermost Silurian hot shales of northern Gondwana are laterally discontinuous and their distribution and thickness were controlled by the early Silurian palaeorelief which was shaped mainly by glacial processes of the late Ordovician ice age and by Pan-African and Infracambrian compressional and extensional tectonism. The thickest and areally most extensive basal Silurian organic-rich shales in North Africa occur in Algeria, Tunisia and western Libya, while on the Arabian Peninsula they are most prolific in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan and Iraq. The hot shales were not deposited in Egypt, which was a large palaeohigh at that time. The depositional model presented may help in better understanding the source potential of the basal Silurian shales in less-explored regions of North Africa and Arabia including Morocco, northern Niger and the Kufra Basin in southeast Libya.

This paper is based principally on the re-examination of the core dataset from the literature, with reconversion of many previously published radiocarbon ages into calendar dates. Seven framework and three detrital facies were identified on the basis of the nature and growth shapes of dominant framework builders, and on that of the texture of sediments, respectively. Framework facies in high-hydrodynamic energy settings were dominated by an association of coralline algae and robust-branching corals (Acropora robusta group, A. gr. humilis, A. palifera, Pocillopora damicornis) with locally encrusting coral forms (faviids). In moderate energy environments, these were replaced by domal (Porites), tabular-branching (Acropora gr. hyacinthus) and arborescent (Acropora gr. muricata), whereas sheltered areas included an association of arborescent, foliaceous (Montipora, Pavona) and encrusting coral species. Detrital facies comprise coral rubble, carbonate sand and mud. On compositional and textural bases, four main sand subfacies were recognized: coralgal rudstone to packstone; coral - Molluscan grainstone/packstone; molluscan - Foraminiferal grainstone/packstone; and green algal (Halimeda) grainstone/packstone. Despite some overlaps in the sand facies association, each subfacies can provide additional support to reconstruction of paleoreef environments. Three types of framework facies association were identified within entire reef-margin sequences: Framework of homogeneous composition reflecting stability of environmental conditions through time; superimposition of two distinct frameworks, usually as deeper water corals overlain by shallower, higher energy ones, and recurrent alternations of shallower and deeper coral assemblages. The two last associations resulted probably from lateral displacements of coral communities in response to rapid changes in accommodation space. Such facies transitions also are described from backreef sediment piles: Gravel graded into sand and mud successively as a result of upward shallowing. The degree of reef development seems to be linked to coral community structure. Communities consisting principally of branching and domal coral forms favoured substantial accretion and the formation of well-developed reefs, whereas assemblages comprising foliaceous and encrusting colonies produced only incipient reefs. Within reef systems, the proportions of detritus over framework tend to increase as hydrodynamic energy declines. The Indo-Pacific reef systems are classified into four anatomy types on the basis of dominant depositional patterns: Balanced aggrading/onlapping, unbalanced aggrading/downlapping, prograding and backstepping types. Vertical accretion rates of frameworks are highly variable and are not directly dictated by coral growth habits. However, the highest rates recorded (up to 20 mm year-1) relate to tabular- and arborescent-acroporid rich sections. Abrupt variations in the aggradation rates of framework are recorded in sequences at the transitional zone between two distinct coral assemblages. In detritus-dominated sequences, accumulation rates range from 0.2 to about 40 mm year-1, with higher values suggesting intense hurricane-controlled deposition. In addition, accretion rates also seem to depend on water-energy conditions. In high-energy environments, aggradation rates did not exceed 12 mm year-1, but reached 25 mm year-1 in more protected areas. By contrast, lateral accretion operated at an average rate of 90 mm year-1 in agitated waters, while it did not exceed the mean rate of 55 mm year-1 in calm waters. Changes in accretion rates appear to be linked to reef growth modes. In the reef zones driven by a "keep-up" mode, mean vertical accretion rates range at around 6 mm year-1. The reef zones developed through a "catch-up" mode at rates of 3-4 mm year-1. There was little variation in accretion rates according to latitude. At the Last Glacial Maximum, from 23 to about 19 ka BP, reefs (Reef Generation RGO) only developed along what were to become the foreslopes of present reefs, forming accumulations a few metres thick at vertical rates of up to 1 mm year-1. The rapid postglacial rise in sea level, from about 19 to 6.5 ka BP, was accompanied by the settlement of three successive reef generations (the so called RGI, RGII and RGIII), within the periods 17.5-14.7, 13.8-11.5 and 10 ka BP to the Present. During the Postglacial transgression, regional to local differences in gross morphology and internal architecture of the reefs have been determined by differing sea-level histories in combination with neotectonics and typographic factors. Locally, reef colonization seems to have been facilitated or prevented chiefly by small-scale topographic features. Development during subsequent deglaciation was probably largely independent of variations in sea surface temperatures. Water turbidity also seems to have been only a minor determinant of reef settlement and growth, but may locally have controlled the composition of coral communities, resulting in the growth of turbidity-tolerant domal and foliaceous forms. Changes in atmospheric CO2 levels remained within the tolerance thresholds for reef calcification. The three main reef growth episodes coincide roughly with rapid increases in atmospheric pCO2. Dust input and variations in sea surface salinities seem to have had a very limited control on reef growth. The LGM was characterized by salinities comparable with those of the present, but by higher dust fluxes. By contrast, nutrient levels, hydrodynamic energy, and to a lesser, extent coral recruitment in relation to substrate availability and ocean circulation, have played major roles in determining reef accretion patterns at both local and regional scales. Two periods of increased upwelling in the western Indian Ocean, at 15.3 and 11.5-10.8 ka BP, coincided with the demise of RGI and RGII. During deglaciation, high-frequency storm events probably led to a scarcity of typical growth framework reefs and favoured the formation of structures composed of reworked and recemented coral framework. Storm control may have been particularly important in the mid-Holocene when water depths over incipient reefs were greater than 5 m. From the LGM to the early Holocene, coral settlement has probably declined due to a lack of suitable nurseries, until the modern patterns of ocean circulation were established and thus favoured larval dispersal from refuges. It is highly desirable to improve analysis of the core database and to increase the number of core-transects, including forereef sites, to enhance our knowledge of Recent reef development. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Cretaceous experienced numerous global and local climatic perturbations to the ocean–atmosphere system, especially during periods of known widespread organic-carbon burial termed oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). The Cenomanian–Turonian boundary event (∼93.9 Ma), or OAE-2, is the best documented and widespread organic carbon (OC) burial event in Earth history—with more than 170 sections published. Despite the substantial number of locations, the majority is found within the proto-Atlantic Ocean, Tethys Ocean and epicontinental seaways. It has been hypothesized that the pervasive burial of OC during OAE-2 caused the observed positive carbon isotope excursion (2 to 7‰ average ∼3‰). The isotope excursion can help constrain the global burial of OC, even for unstudied portions of the global ocean. This approach can solve for ‘missing' OC sinks by comparing model estimates with the known distribution of OAE-2 sediments and their OC contents. Specifically, mapping the known spatial extent of OC burial in terms of mass accumulation rates (MARs), and comparing those results with the prediction using a forward box model to derive the amount of OC burial to reproduce the globally observed positive carbon isotope excursion. The available OC data from outcrop and drill core, with reasonable extrapolation to analogous settings without data, quantifies ∼13% of the total seafloor, mostly from marginal marine and epicontinental/epeiric settings. However, this extrapolation for OC burial, plus using most appropriate MARs to unknown portions of the seafloor, fail to account for the amount of OC burial predicted for a 3‰ positive carbon isotope excursion. This discrepancy remains even when considering additional sinks of organic carbon burial such as coal, lacustrine environments, authigenic carbonate, and the loss of OC associated with hydrocarbon reservoirs. This outcome points to a large reservoir of OC that is not currently constrained, such as highly productive margins and/or equatorial regions, or a small but significant increase deep ocean OC burial. Another possibility is that the carbon fluxes are less than those used in the model which would require less OC burial to explain a ∼3‰ carbon isotope excursion.},

abstract = {Glaciations have occurred episodically at different time intervals and for different durations in Earth's history. Ice covers have formed in a wide range of plate tectonic and structural settings but the bulk of Earth's glacial record can be shown to have been deposited and preserved in basins within extensional settings. In such basins, source area uplift and basin subsidence fulfill the tectonic preconditions for the initiation of glaciation and the accomodation and preservation of glaciclastic sediments. Tectonic setting, in particular subsidence rates, also dictates the type of glaciclastic facies and facies successions that are deposited. Many pre-Pleistocene glaciated basins commonly contain well-defined tectonostratigraphic successions recording the interplay of tectonics and sedimentation; traditional climatostratigraphic approaches involving interpretation in terms of either ice advance/retreat cycles or glacio-eustatic sea-level change require revision. The direct record of continental glaciation in Earth history, in the form of classically-recognised continental glacial landforms and "tillites", is meagre; it is probable that more than 95% of the volume of preserved "glacial" strata are glacially-influenced marine deposits that record delivery of large amounts of glaciclastic sediment to offshore basins. This flux has been partially or completely reworked by "normal" sedimentary processes such that the record of glaciation and climate change is recorded in marine successions and is difficult to decipher. The dominant "glacial" facies in the rock record are subaqueous debris flow diamictites and turbidites recording the selective preservation of poorly-sorted glaciclastic sediment deposited in deep water basins by sediment gravity flows. However, these facies are also typical of many non-glacial settings, especially volcanically-influenced environments; numerous Archean and Proterozoic diamictites, described in the older literature as tillites, have no clearly established glacial parentage. The same remarks apply to many successions of laminated and thin-bedded facies interpreted as "varvites". Despite suggestions of much lower values of solar luminosity (the weak young sun hypothesis), the stratigraphic record of Archean glaciations is not extensive and may be the result of non-preservation. However, the effects of very different Archean global tectonic regimes and much higher geothermal heat flows, combined with a Venus-like atmosphere warmed by elevated levels of CO2, cannot be ruled out. The oldest unambiguous glacial succession in Earth history appears to be the Early Proterozoic Gowganda Formation of the Huronian Supergroup in Ontario; the age of this event is not well-constrained but glaciation coincided with regional rifting, and may be causally related to, oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere just after 2300 Ma. New evidence that oxygenation is tectonically, not biologically driven, stresses the intimate relationship between plate tectonics, evolution of the atmosphere and glaciation. Global geochemical controls, such as elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, may be responsible for a long mid-Proterozoic non-glacial interval after 2000 Ma that was terminated by the Late Proterozoic glaciations just after 800 Ma. A persistent theme in both Late Proterozoic and Phanerozoic glaciations is the adiabatic effect of tectonic uplift, either along collisional margins or as a result of passive margin uplifts in areas of extended crust, as the trigger for glaciation; the process is reinforced by global geochemical feedback, principally the drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and Milankovitch "astronomical" forcing but these are unlikely, by themselves, to inititiate glaciation. The same remarks apply to late Cenozoic glaciations. Late Proterozoic glacially-influenced strata occur on all seven continents and fall into two tectonostratigraphic types. In the first category are thick sucessions of turbidites and mass flows deposited along active, compressional plate margins recording a protracted and complex phase of supercontinent assembly between 800 and 550 Ma. Local cordilleran glaciations of volcanic peaks is indicated. Many deposits are preserved within mobile belts that record the subduction of interior oceans now preserved as "welds" between different cratons. Discrimination between glacially-influenced and non-glacial, volcaniclastic mass flow successions continues to be problematic. The second tectonostratigraphic category of Late Proterozoic glacial strata includes successions of glacially-influenced, mostly marine strata deposited along rifted, extensional plate margins. The oldest (Sturtian) glaciclastic sediments result from the break-out of Laurentia from the Late Proterozoic supercontinent starting around 750 Ma along its "palaeo-Pacific" margin with a later (Marinoan) phase of rifting at about 650 Ma. "Passive margin" uplifts and the generation of "adiabatic" ice covers on uplifted crustal blocks triggered widespread glaciation along the "palaeo-Pacific" margin of North America and in Australia. A major phase of rifting along the opposite ("palaeo-Atlantic") margin of Laurentia occurred after 650 Ma and is similarly recorded by glaciclastic strata in basins preserved around the margins of the present day North Atlantic Ocean. Glaciation of the west African platform after 650 Ma is closely related to collision of the West African and Guyanan cratons and uplift of the orogenic belt; the same process, involving uplift around the northern and western margins of the Afro-Arabian platform subsequently triggered Late Ordovician glaciation at about 440 Ma when the south polar region lay over North Africa. Early Silurian glaciation in Bolivia and Brazil was followed by a non-glacial episode and renewed Late Devonian glaciation of northern Brazil and Bolivia. The latter event may have resulted from rotation of Gondwana under the South Pole combined with active orogenesis along the western margin of the supercontinent. Hercynian uplift along the western margin of South America caused by the collision and docking of "Chilinia" at about 350 Ma (Late Tournasian-Early Visean) was the starting point of a long Late Palaeozoic glacial record that terminated at about 255 Ma (Kungurian-Kazanian) in western Australia. The arrival of large landmasses at high latitude may have been an important precondition for ice growth. Strong Namurian uplift around virtually the entire palaeo-Pacific rim of Gondwana culminated in glaciation of the interior of the supercontinent during the latest Westphalian (c. 300 Ma). There is a clear picture of plate margin compression and propagation of "far field" stresses to the plate interior allowing preservation of glacially-influenced strata in newly-rifted intracratonic basins. Many basins show a "steer's head" style of infill architecture recording successive phases of subsidence and overstepping of younger strata during basin subsidence and expansion. Exploration for oil and gas in Gondwanan glaciated basins is currently a major stimulus to understanding the relationship between tectonics and sedimentation. Warm Mesozoic palaeoclimates do not rule out the existence of restricted ice covers in the interiors of continental landmasses at high palaeolatitudes (e.g. Siberia, Antarctica) but there is as yet, no direct geological record of their existence. The most likely record of glaciers is contained in Late Jurassic and early Cretaceous strata. In any event, these ice masses are unlikely to have had any marked effect on global sea levels and alternative explanations should perhaps be sought for 4th order, so-called "glacio-eustatic" changes in sea level, inferred from Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous strata. The growth of extensive Northern Hemisphere ice sheets in Plio-Pleistocene time (c. 2.5 Ma) was the culmination of a long global climatic deterioration that began sometime after 60 Ma during the late Tertiary. Tectonic uplift of areas such as the Tibetan Plateau and plate tectonic reorganizations have been identified as first-order controls. Initiation of the East Antarctic ice sheet, at about 36 Ma, is the result of the progressive thermal isolation of the continent combined with uplift along the Transantarctic Mountains. In the Northern Hemisphere, the upwarping of extensive passive margin plateaux around the margins of the newly-rifted North Atlantic may have amplified global climatic changes and set the scene for the growth of continental ice sheets after 2.5 Ma. Ice sheet growth and decay was driven by complexly interrelated changes in ocean circulation, Milankovitch orbital forcing and global geochemical cycles. It is arguable whether continental glaciations of the Northern Hemisphere, and the evolution of hominids, would have occurred without the necessary precondition of tectonic uplift. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The temperature of ancient oceans is an important constraint for understanding the climate history of our planet. The classical oxygen isotope paleothermometry on fossil shells, while very proficient when applied to the younger (Cenozoic) portion of the geologic record, is believed to yield only unreliable results for the Phanerozoic "deep time", either because the empirically well documented secular trend to more negative $\delta$18O values with increasing age was generated by post-depositional recrystallization processes or, if primary, implies ecologically unpalatable hot early oceans. Here we present a compilation of $\delta$18O measurements for 58,532 low-Mg calcite marine shells that cover almost the entire Phanerozoic eon, argue that the secular decline of about -6‰ is primary, propose that it reflects the changing oxygen isotopic composition of sea water, and define a new baseline trend for $\delta$18O of paleo-sea water; the latter providing a new template for calculation of ambient habitat temperatures of fossil specimens. The resulting pattern for fossil taxa (foraminifera, brachiopods, belemnites and bivalves) mimics their modern counterparts in temperature ranges and modes. This conceptual framework enables application of actualistic concepts to ambient habitat temperatures of fossils and provides us with a long overdue tool for interpretation of "deep time" geologic history.},

abstract = {It is well established that greenhouse conditions prevailed during the Cretaceous Period ($\sim$ 145–66 Ma). Determining the exact nature of the greenhouse-gas forcing, climatic warming and climate sensitivity remains, however, an active topic of research. Quantitative and qualitative geochemical and palaeontological proxies provide valuable observational constraints on Cretaceous climate. In particular, reconstructions of Cretaceous sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) have been revolutionised firstly by the recognition that clay-rich sequences can host exceptionally preserved planktonic foraminifera allowing for reliable oxygen-isotope analyses and, secondly by the development of the organic palaeothermometer TEX 86 based on the distribution of marine archaeal membrane lipids. Here we provide a new compilation and synthesis of available planktonic foraminiferal $\delta$ 18 O ($\delta$ 18 O pl ) and TEX 86 -SST proxy data for almost the entire Cretaceous Period. The compilation uses SSTs recalculated from published raw data, allowing examination of the sensitivity of each proxy to the calculation method (e.g., choice of calibration) and places all data on a common timescale. Overall, the compilation shows many similarities with trends present in individual records of Cretaceous climate change. For example, both SST proxies and benthic foraminiferal $\delta$ 18 O records indicate maximum warmth in the Cenomanian–Turonian interval. Our reconstruction of the evolution of latitudinal temperature gradients (low, <±30° minus higher, >±48° palaeolatitudes) reveals temporal changes. In the Valanginian–Aptian, the low-to-higher mid-latitudinal temperature gradient was weak (decreasing from $\sim$ 10–17 °C in the Valanginian, to $\sim$ 3–5 °C in the Aptian, based on TEX 86 -SSTs). In the Cenomanian–Santonian, reconstructed latitudinal temperature contrasts are also small relative to modern (< 14 °C, based on low-latitude TEX 86 and $\delta$ 18 O pl SSTs minus higher latitude $\delta$ 18 O pl SSTs, compared with $\sim$ 20 °C for the modern). In the mid-Campanian to end-Maastrichtian, latitudinal temperature gradients strengthened ($\sim$ 19–21 °C, based on low-latitude TEX 86 and $\delta$ 18 O pl SSTs minus higher latitude $\delta$ 18 O pl SSTs), with cooling occurring at low-, middle- and higher palaeolatitude sites, implying global surface-ocean cooling and/or changes in ocean heat transport in the Late Cretaceous. These reconstructed long-term trends are resilient, regardless of the choice of proxy (TEX 86 or $\delta$ 18 O pl ) or calibration. This new Cretaceous SST synthesis provides an up-to-date target for modelling studies investigating the mechanics of extreme climates.},

abstract = {Previous studies have made extensive use of dinoflagellate cysts to reconstruct past sea surface temperature (SST). Analysis of associations of dinoflagellate cysts using two new ocean datasets for the mid Eocene (Bartonian) and early Oligocene (Rupelian) reveals clear latitudinally constrained distributions for the Bartonian, but unexpected changes in their Rupelian distribution; a significant number of species with low and mid latitude northern hemisphere occurrences in the Bartonian extend their northward ranges in the Rupelian, including some forms characterised as 'warm water' by previous studies. This suggests either that dinoflagellates are faithfully tracking a complex oceanographic response to Rupelian cooling, or that dinoflagellate sensitivity/adaptability to a range of ecological variables means that at a global scale their distributions are not primarily controlled by sea surface temperature-variability.Previous use of dinoflagellate cysts for palaeoclimate work has relied on rather subjective and inconsistent identification of 'warm' and 'cold' water forms, rather than comprehensive analysis of community associations at the global-scale. It is clear from this study that a better understanding of the (palaeo-)ecology of dinoflagellates and their cysts is required.Rupelian dinoflagellate cyst distribution may reflect changes in a range of environmental variables linked to early Oligocene climate-cooling, for example changes in nutrient fluxes triggered by glacially-induced base-level fall; complex reorganisation of ocean current systems between the Bartonian and Rupelian, or muted changes to Rupelian summer SSTs in the northern hemisphere that have previously been reported. Many extant dinoflagellate species also exhibit relatively broad temperature tolerance. Moreover, they have potentially extensive cryptic diversity, and are able to produce dormant cysts during short-lived environmental deterioration, all of which may act to limit the value of undifferentiated dinoflagellate cyst assemblages for identifying climate signals.},

abstract = {Evidence from modern rivers and the deep-time geological record attests to the fundamental importance of plant life for the construction of physical habitats within fluvial environments. Data from an extensive literature review and original fieldwork demonstrates that many landforms and geomorphic features of modern river systems appear in the Palaeozoic stratigraphic record once terrestrial vegetation had adopted certain evolutionary advances. For example, stable point bars are associated with the onset of rooted plants in the Siluro-Devonian and avulsive and anabranching fluvial systems become common at the same time as extensive arborescent vegetation in the Carboniferous. In this paper, we demonstrate a correlation between the diversification of physical fluvial environments and the expansion of terrestrial fauna and flora, with an emphasis on the culmination of these trends within Carboniferous alluvial systems. Many extrinsic factors have been considered as possible controls on the evolutionary timelines of terrestrialization for organisms. However, a fundamental prerequisite for achieving terrestrial biodiversity was the variety of physical habitats, especially riparian systems, available for newly evolved organisms. In association with abundant lowland meandering systems, the widespread appearance across Carboniferous alluvial plains of fixed-channel and anabranching reaches created further physical landforms for colonization and would have promoted increasingly complex hyporheic flow regimes. Furthermore the associated increase in arborescent vegetation and supply of large woody debris to inland and coastal rivers would have created a wealth of microhabitats for continental organisms. We argue that the expanding extent and diversity of physical alluvial niches during the Palaeozoic is an underappreciated driver of the terrestrialization of early continental life. The study of the deep-time fossil and stratigraphic record also illustrates that vegetation is a fundamental prerequisite for the creation of biogeomorphic alluvial landforms and physical habitats and microhabitats. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

The palaeogeography has been rapidly recognized as a key factor controlling the long-term evolution of the atmospheric CO2 through its capability of modulating the efficiency of the silicate weathering. First the role of the latitudinal position of the continents has been emphasized: an averaged low latitudinal position promotes the CO2 consumption by silicate weathering, and is theoretically associated to low CO2 periods. With the increase of model complexity and the explicit consideration of the hydrological cycle, the importance of the continentality factor has been recognized: periods of supercontinent assembly coincide with high pCO2 values due to the development of arid conditions which weaken the silicate weathering efficiency. These fundamental feedbacks between climate, carbon cycle and tectonic have been discovered by pioneer modelling studies and opened new views in the understanding of the history of Earth's climate. Today, some of the key features of the Phanerozoic climate can be explained by: (1) continental drift; (2) small continental blocks moving to tropical belts; and (3) modulation of the climate sensitivity to CO2 by palaeogeography changes. Those results emphasize the need for a careful process-based modelling of the water cycle and climate response to the continental drift. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {A significant number of new palaeomagnetic poles have become available since the last time a compilation was made (assembled in 2005, published in 2008) to indicate to us that a new and significantly expanded set of tables with palaeomagnetic results would be valuable, with results coming from the Gondwana cratonic elements, Laurentia, Baltica/Europe, and Siberia. Following the Silurian Caledonian Orogeny, Laurentia's and Baltica's apparent polar wander paths (APWPs) can be merged into a Laurussia path, followed in turn by a merger of the Laurussia and Siberia data from latest Permian time onward into a Laurasian combined path. Meanwhile, after about 320 Ma, Gondwana's and Laurussia/Laurasia's path can be combined into what comes steadily closer to the ideal of a Global Apparent Polar Wander Path (GAPWaP) for late Palaeozoic and younger times. Tests for True Polar Wander (TPW) episodes are now feasible since Pangaea fusion and we identify four important episodes of Mesozoic TPW between 250 and 100 Ma. TPW rates are in the order of 0.45-0.8o/M.y. but cumulative TPW is nearly zero since the Late Carboniferous. With the exception of a few intervals where data are truly scarce (e.g., 390–340 Ma), the palaeomagnetic database is robust and allows us to make a series of new palaeogeographic reconstructions from the Late Cambrian to the Palaeogene.},

abstract = {New palaeogeographical reconstructions are presented for eleven time intervals through the Palaeozoic of the eastern Asia region from the Middle Cambrian at 510. Ma to the end of the Permian at 250. Ma. They centre on the continental blocks of North China, South China, and Annamia (Indochina) and their relationships with northeastern Gondwana (which was united to form part of Pangea from the Late Carboniferous onwards). Also shown is the continent of Tarim during the Lower Palaeozoic, as well as the Hutag Uul-Songliao and Khanka-Jiamasu-Bureya terranes, both of which straddle the Russian, Mongolian and Chinese borders today, from Silurian times onwards. We conclude that Annamia and South China were united as a single continent throughout the Lower Palaeozoic and Early Devonian and were translocated by major strike-slip faulting along the northeastern Gondwana margin during that period from off Afghanistan to outboard of the Sibumasu and Australian sectors of the superterrane. They left the Gondwana marginal area together during the Lower Devonian opening of the Palaeotethys Ocean, but very shortly afterwards they themselves divided into the two separate continental blocks that we recognise today, not to reunite until the Triassic. The various Cambrian to Permian rocks found in Japan largely represent active volcanic arcs which originally lay to the southeast of South China, although the Carboniferous was more quiescent there. The Neotethys Ocean opened during the Permian, dividing Sibumasu and the Tibetan terranes from Gondwana, and the Palaeotethys Ocean started to close progressively in the Upper Palaeozoic as most of the East Asian continents and smaller terranes moved towards Siberia. The positions of the various continents and terranes have been deduced from a mixture of palaeomagnetic and faunal data, the positions of Large Igneous Provinces and kimberlites, and the need to provide kinematic continuity between maps of successive ages. However, many uncertainties remain. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, using a novel multidimensional functional framework and comprehensive null-models, we compare the functional structure of Cambrian, Silurian and modern benthic marine biotas. We demonstrate that, after controlling for increases in taxonomic diversity, functional richness increased incrementally between each time interval with benthic taxa filling progressively more functional space, combined with a significant functional dissimilarity between periods. The modern benthic biota functionally overlaps with fossil biotas but some modern taxa, especially large predators, have new trait combinations that may allow more functions to be performed. From a methodological perspective, these results illustrate the benefits of using multidimensional instead of lower dimensional functional frameworks when studying changes in functional diversity over space and time. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

We show that such an approach, augmented by a mechanistic analysis of trade-offs among functional traits, can be successfully used to explain community composition of marine phytoplankton along environmental gradients. Our analysis of literature on major functional traits in phytoplankton, such as parameters of nutrient-dependent growth and uptake, reveals physiological trade-offs in species abilities to acquire and utilize resources. These trade-offs, arising from fundamental relations such as cellular scaling laws and enzyme kinetics, define contrasting ecological strategies of nutrient acquisition. Major groups of marine eukaryotic phytoplankton have adopted distinct strategies with associated traits. These diverse strategies of nutrient utilization can explain the distribution patterns of major functional groups and size classes along nutrient availability gradients. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Latitudinal temperature gradients are a defining characteristic of the climate system. Using thermometric indicators, including $\delta$ 18 O, plant and animal fossils, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) proxies, and clumped isotope estimates, we document marine and terrestrial temperature gradients for the latest Cretaceous, Late Paleocene-Early Eocene, Early Oligocene, Pliocene, and Recent. The changes in gradients reflect the transition greenhouse to icehouse conditions. The evolution of latitudinal temperature gradients in marine and terrestrial realms are similar but has some distinctive differences. Marine temperatures are generally warmer than those on land. Except for the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene, the marine records show distinct inflection points at $\sim$30° and $\sim$50° latitude indicating the existence of frontal systems in the ocean. Except for the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene, the marine records show an increasingly steeper trend, from latest Cretaceous through Recent, being most pronounced after the Early Oligocene greenhouse-icehouse transition. This trend reflects the increasing intensity of high-latitude and polar cooling as the icehouse state developed. During the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene the oceans were characterized by slightly warmer tropics and much warmer higher latitudes than at present. The continents have generally had tropical temperatures like those of today, varying by <5 °C. Higher latitude temperatures cooled during the latest Cretaceous, became much warmer during the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene, then cooled during the Early Oligocene and have become increasingly colder since then. The results suggest that there is a climate thermostat mechanism, probably related to greenhouse gas concentrations, that ameliorates tropical warming by redistributing warmth to the poles in the greenhouse world. That mechanism broke down as greenhouse gas concentrations declined resulting in the conversion from greenhouse to icehouse conditions.},

abstract = {Microbial carbonates were major components of early Paleozoic reefs until coral-stromatoporoid-bryozoan reefs appeared in the mid-Ordovician. Microbial reefs were augmented by archaeocyath sponges for $\sim$15 Myr in the early Cambrian, by lithistid sponges for the remaining $\sim$25 Myr of the Cambrian, and then by lithistid, calathiid and pulchrilaminid sponges for the first $\sim$25 Myr of the Ordovician. The factors responsible for mid–late Cambrian microbial-lithistid sponge reef dominance remain unclear. Although oxygen increase appears to have significantly contributed to the early Cambrian ‘Explosion' of marine animal life, it was followed by a prolonged period dominated by ‘greenhouse' conditions, as sea-level rose and CO2 increased. The mid–late Cambrian was unusually warm, and these elevated temperatures can be expected to have lowered oxygen solubility, and to have promoted widespread thermal stratification resulting in marine dysoxia and hypoxia. Greenhouse conditions would also have stimulated carbonate platform development, locally further limiting shallow-water circulation. Low marine oxygenation has been linked to episodic extinctions of phytoplankton, trilobites and other metazoans during the mid–late Cambrian. We propose that this tendency to dysoxia-hypoxia in shallow marine environments also limited many metazoan reef-builders. In contrast, during the mid–late Cambrian, the ability of lithistid sponges to withstand low oxygen levels allowed them to create a benthic association with microbial carbonates that dominated global reefs. These conditions ameliorated during the Ordovician, as temperature decline promoted ocean ventilation. The prolonged time gap occupied by low diversity reefs between the ‘Cambrian Explosion' and the ‘Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event' reflects elevated temperatures and reduced marine oxygenation that limited metazoan diversification in shallow marine environments.},

abstract = {Incomplete preservation, heterogeneous geographic sampling, uncertainties in palaeogeographic reconstructions and inconsistencies of reef definitions bias global reef patterns observed in the geological record. This sampling bias is added to a biological habitat area effect, which is thought to be of paramount importance for modern reefs. To evaluate the importance of sampling bias of ancient reefs, I first tested the habitat area effect and sampling bias for modern tropical reefs and then evaluated these factors for pre-Pleistocene Phanerozoic reefs. Results suggest that habitat area, although significantly affecting Phanerozoic reef patterns, is considerably less important than sampling bias. Sampling bias is more controlled by socioeconomic factors than by geological processes such as subduction of oceanic crust or sea-level fluctuations. Reefs are more likely to be sampled in rich countries, irrespective of geological and ecological controls. The numeric and geographic distribution of reefs as currently recorded in the published literature is thus probably largely artifactual, which may explain the scarcity of significant correlations between reef distribution patterns and inferred physico-chemical controls. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {The ‘COPSE' (Carbon, Oxygen, Phosphorus, Sulphur and Evolution) biogeochemical model predicts the coupled histories and controls on atmospheric O2, CO2 and ocean composition over Phanerozoic time. The forwards modelling approach utilized in COPSE makes it a useful tool for testing mechanistic hypotheses against geochemical data and it has been extended and altered a number of times since being published in 2004. Here we undertake a wholesale revision of the model, incorporating: (1) elaboration and updating of the external forcing factors; (2) improved representation of existing processes, including plant effects on weathering and ocean anoxia; (3) inclusion of additional processes and tracers, including seafloor weathering, volcanic rock weathering and 87Sr/86Sr; (4) updating of the present-day baseline fluxes; and (5) a more efficient and robust numerical scheme. A key aim is to explore how sensitive predictions of atmospheric CO2, O2 and ocean composition are to model updates and ongoing uncertainties. The revised model reasonably captures the long-term trends in Phanerozoic geochemical proxies for atmospheric pCO2, pO2, ocean [SO4], carbonate $\delta$13C, sulphate $\delta$34S and carbonate 87Sr/86Sr. It predicts a two-phase drawdown of atmospheric CO2 with the rise of land plants and associated cooling phases in the Late Ordovician and Devonian-early Carboniferous, followed by broad peaks of atmospheric CO2 and temperature in the Triassic and mid-Cretaceous – although some of the structure in the CO2 proxy record is missed. The model robustly predicts a mid-Paleozoic oxygenation event due to the earliest land plants, with O2 rising from $\sim$ 5% to > 17% of the atmosphere and oxygenating the ocean. Thereafter, atmospheric O2 is effectively regulated with remaining fluctuations being a Carboniferous–Permian O2 peak $\sim$ 26% linked to burial of terrestrial organic matter in coal swamps, a Triassic–Jurassic O2 minimum $\sim$ 21% linked to low uplift, a Cretaceous O2 peak $\sim$ 26% linked to high degassing and weathering fluxes, and a Cenozoic O2 decline.},

These can be grouped into three facies associations that include, from bottom to top: a carbonate facies association (FA-1), a mixed siliciclastic and carbonate facies association (FA-2) and an encrinitic facies association (FA-3). These mid-to outer-ramp strata represent deposition mostly from episodic, high-energy storm events as evidenced by their sharp bases, hummocky cross-stratification, large wave ripples, gutter casts and wave-enhanced sediment gravity flow deposits. Superimposed on a long-term regressive trend, one main transgressive-regressive (TR) sequence and four meter-scale TR cycles are evident, indicating a multi-order stratigraphic framework developed under the influence of glacio-eustasy.

Episodic or long periodic oceanic events may be a factor in accelerating evolutionary changes and eliminating taxa that cannot adapt to the change in the oceanic environment. The intent of this review is to identify various oceanographic phenomena that have the potential to invoke sufficient global modifications to the ocean to effect biological change. It will be assumed that short term or local events such as tides, seasonal upwelling, tropical storms, or El Nino like events, because of their high frequency in terms of geologic time or evolutionary change provide noise to a basic environmental pattern to which organisms adapt without producing rapid evolutionary change.-from Authors},

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2-4%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {During the Early Paleozoic, transgressions and the distribution of sedimentary facies on the northern Gondwana margin were controlled by a regional NNW-SSE to almost north-south striking structural relief. In Early Silurian times, a eustatic highstand enabled the sea to reach its maximum southward extent. The counterclockwise rotation of Gondwana during the Cambrian and Early Ordovician caused the northern Gondwana margin to shift from intertropical to southern polar latitudes in Ordovician times. Glacial and periglacial deposits are reported from many localities in Morocco, Algeria, Niger, Libya, Chad, Sudan, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The Late Ordovician glacia-tion phase was followed by a period of a major gla-cioeustatic sea-level rise in the Early Silurian due to the retreat of the ice-cap. As a consequence of the decreasing water circulation in the basin centers (Central Ara-bia, Murzuk-and Ghadames basins), highly bituminous euxinic shales were deposited. These shales are considered to be the main source rock of Paleozoic oil and gas deposits in parts of Saudi Arabia, Libya and Algeria. The following regression in the southern parts of the Early Silurian sea was probably caused by a second gla-cial advance, which was mainly restricted to areas in Chad, Sudan and Niger. Evidence for glacial activity and fluvioglacial sedimentation is available from rocks overlying the basal Silurian shale in northeast Chad and northwest Sudan. The Early Silurian ice advance is considered to be responsible for the termination of euxinic shale deposition in the basin centers.},

This understanding is based both on real observations and on the results from numerical simulations. The main emphasis in this review is on the atmosphere and oceans. First, balance equations describing the large-scale climate and its evolution in time are derived from the basic thermohydrodynamic laws of classical physics. The observed atmosphere-ocean system is then described by showing how the balances of radiation, mass, angular momentum, water, and energy are maintained during present climatic conditions. Next, a hierarchy of mathematical models that successfully simulate various aspects of the climate is discussed, and examples are given of how three-dimensional general circulation models are being used to increase our understanding of the global climate "machine." Finally, the possible impact of human activities on climate is discussed, with main emphasis on likely future heating due to the release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. {\textcopyright} 1984 The American Physical Society.},

As part of the reassessment, quartz sand grains from deposits identified as glacial boulder clays (till composed of boulders in a clay or silt matrix) were analyzed by scanning electron microscope for evidence of their sedimentary history. Surface textures found on the boulder-clay grains were compared with those on grains with known sedimentary histories including glacial, gras, colluvial, and alluvial grains. The analysis shows that the grains lack typical glacial textures. The surface textures present indicate a complex history. Nonuniformly weathered grain surfaces point to chemical weathering of the source rock. This is supported by the deep weathering of the nonquartz clasts in the sand-sized fraction as well as in boulders at the outcrops. The close correspondence in surface-texture frequencies with those of the alluvial grains indicates an alluvial component to the grains' history. The similarity with the colluvial grains and the outcrops' structures suggest an alluvial/colluvial origin for the deposits. The history indicated by the surface textures agrees with the recent reassessment of the geomorphic features and points to warm climatic conditions in east-central China for at least part of the Pleistocene. {\textcopyright} 1997 University of Washington.},

abstract = {Although largely circumstantial in character, evidence for orbitally-forced (Milankovitch) climate changes in Jurassic microrhythmic successions, such as those of the Lias and Kimmeridgian, is becoming more persuasive. We present here the results of experiments, using a general circulation model, testing ways in which orbitally-induced variations in solar energy might be translated into a Jurassic climate response. In particular, we address the problem of the 100 ka (eccentricity-forced) cycle. This is generally considered to have only a small direct effect on solar input. It would be expected to have little impact on an ice-free Earth (commonly assumed for the Jurassic). Nonetheless, this weak signal is claimed to have been recognized in many Jurassic successions. Our results simulate, for the Late Jurassic, the possible effects at the 'minimum' and 'maximum' extremes of seasonal forcing (i.e. comparable with those affecting the Earth at 115 and 9 ka bp, respectively). Model predictions are critically evaluated against the geological database. At times of 'minimum seasonal forcing' there is a significant expansion in the area of the Northern hemisphere monsoon. In the tropics, changes in precipitation predominate over changes in temperature, whereas at high southern latitudes there are very large seasonal variations in temperature, and heavy winter snows. During these times the model is close to predicting a modest, but significant, Jurassic ice-cap in the Antarctic. Ice build-up is particular larly likely over uplands. Such an ice-cap disappears at times of 'maximum seasonal forcing'. Waxing and waning of ice may thus provide the elusive mechanism for metre-scale sea-level changes. It is argued that apparently similar microrhythms (e.g. limestone-shale) might be the sedimentary response to different climatic signals in different climate zones, cause and effect being exactly the opposite in some circumstances. {\textcopyright} 1995 The Geological Society.},

abstract = {Cretaceous climate has long been the focus of modeling studies, both for its unique nature and the need for understanding the fundamental climate processes and feedbacks during times of CO 2 induced "greenhouse" conditions. Prior simulations of Cretaceous climate using global climate models (GCMs) have not been successful in reproducing the low meridional thermal gradients and warm winter continental interior temperatures indicated by proxy climate data, forcing the equability of the Cretaceous to be questioned. Increased poleward ocean heat transport has been cited as a mechanism for maintaining low meridional thermal gradients during the Cretaceous. However, ocean heat transport values larger than the present day are difficult to reconcile with known physical oceanographic principles. In addition, low meridional thermal gradients suggest sluggish atmospheric circulation, implying that the advection of heat into the continental interiors would have been limited. Until recently, the effects of terrestrial ecosystems on pre-Quaternary climates have largely been ignored. Terrestrial ecosystems influence the global climate by affecting the exchange of energy, water, and momentum between the land surface and the atmosphere and provide an important boundary condition for pre-Quaternary climate simulations. Campanian (80 Ma) climate has been simulated using the GENESIS Version 2.0 Global Climate Model. To include the physical effects of vegetation on Campanian climate, a predictive Equilibrium Vegetation Ecology model (EVE) has been applied as a fully interactive component of the simulation. The coupled GENESIS-EVE model has reproduced the overall warmth, low meridional thermal gradients, and warm winter continental interiors characteristic of the Late Cretaceous. The simulated surface air temperatures, precipitation patterns, and predicted vegetation are well correlated with the geologic record at all latitudes. Late Cretaceous Antarctic and northern high latitude forests played an important role in the maintenance of low meridional thermal gradients, polar warmth, and equable continental interiors. Late Cretaceous forests decreased surface albedo, especially in the late winter and early spring prior to snow melt, and increased net radiation and latent heat flux. This contributed to tropospheric warming and increased atmospheric moisture. The warm, moist Late Cretaceous atmosphere moderated winter cooling of high-latitude sea-surface temperatures, increased meridional latent heat transport, and aided the advection of heat into the continental interiors despite reduced surface meridional thermal gradients.},

abstract = {Sequence and biostratigraphic analysis of the margin of the Apulian carbonate platform in the Montagna della Maiella (central Italy) reveal a platform margin evolution that is controlled by long-term sea-level changes, tectonism and changing platform morphology. The Upper Cretaceous to Miocene strata can be subdivided into six supersequences that are separated by deeply incised truncation surfaces. Biostratigraphy documents a major hiatus for all but one of these boundaries. The supersequences reflect distinct stages of platform development, thus the depositional systems remained the same within each supersequence but changed across the supersequence boundaries. The Apulian platform grew on a passive margin of the Jurassic-Cretaceous (Neo-) Tethys. During the early platform history, subsidence rates decreased exponentially with time and controlled the long-term aggradation potential of the platform. The generally decreasing total subsidence rates permitted the basin in front of the platform to be filled up by the Late Campanian strata (Supersequence [SS] 1), resulting in a change from aggradation to progradation. This enabled slope carbonates of Late Campanian to Late Eocene age (SS 2 to 4 and lower part of SS 5) and finally shallow-water platform carbonates of Late Eocene to Late Miocene age (upper part of SS 5 to SS 6) to prograde basinwards. The supersequence boundaries are to a large extent controlled by long-term (2nd-order) eustatic sea-level changes, but climate and tectonism influenced their duration and expression. Climate, initially tropical to subtropical but temperate in Miocene time, and the respective evolution of flora and fauna were major controls on sequence architecture but did not significantly influence the formation of the supersequence boundaries. The tectonic movements related to Alpine orogeny and foreland basin development were not able to completely obliterate the long-term eustatic signal but greatly enhanced the boundaries, although the exact amount of this influence cannot be assessed. Platform morphology was very influential on sequence architecture. From at least Early Cretaceous to Late Campanian time, the presence of a steep escarpment resulted in detached sequences, consisting of an onlapping basinal part and an aggrading part on the platform top, separated by a bypass slope. In Late Campanian to Oligocene time, a distally steepened slope profile was deeply incised, most pronounced along the platform margin and the upper slope, during 2nd-order sea-level lowstands. Sea-level fluctuations along the gently inclined Miocene shelf resulted in deposition of deepening-upward sequences under conditions of low carbonate productivity.},

The exceptional development of the Hirnantian and of part of the Rhuddanian in the Hodh area, compared with the highly condensed sequences representing the contemporaneous deposits in the northern Sahara Basins, suggests an end-glacial transgressive event followed by a northward progradational event.},

abstract = {A new precipitation climatology covering the European Alsp is presented. The analysis covers the entire mountain range including adjacent foreland areas and exhibits a resolution of about 25 km. It is based on observations at one of the densest rain-gauge networks over complex topography world-wide, embracing more than 6600 stations from the high-resolution networks of the Alpine countries. The climatology is determined from daily analyses of bias-uncorrected, quality controlled data for the 20 year period 1971-1990. The daily precipitation fields were produced with an advanced distance-weighting scheme commonly adopted for the analysis of precipitation on a global scale. The paper describes the baseline seasonal measns derived from the daily analysis fields. The results depict the mesoscale distribution of the Alpine precipitation climate, its relation to the topography, and its seasonal cycle. Gridded analysis results are also provided in digital form. The most prominent Alpine effects include the enhancement of precipitation along the Alpine foothills, and the shielding of the inner-Alpine valleys. A detailed analysis along a section across the Alps also demonstrates that a simple precipitation-height relationship does not exist on the Alpine scale, because much of the topographic signal is associated with slope and shielding rather than height effects. Although systematic biases associated wtih the rain-gauge measurement and the topographic clustering of the stations are not corrected for, a qualitative validation of the results, using existing national climatologies shows good agreement on the mesoscale. Furthermore a comparison is made between the present climatology and the Alpine sections of the global climatology of Legates and Willmott and the Greater European climatology from the Climate Research Unit (University of East Anglia). Results indicate that the pattern and magnitude of analysed. Alpine precipitation critically depend upon the density of available observations and the analysis procedure adopted.},

abstract = {Carbonate fixation in the ocean proceeds in three basic modes: abiotically, biotically induced (with organic trigger), and biotically controlled (where organisms determine timing, location and composition of the product). The three modes combine in a variety of ways to produce carbonate sediment. When viewed on the scale of formations and global facies belts, three benthic carbonate production systems, or factories, emerge: (1) the tropical shallow-water system, dominated by biotically controlled (mainly photoautotrophic) and abiotic precipitates: (2) the cool-water system, dominated by biotically controlled (mainly heterotrophic) precipitates; and (3) the mud-mound system, dominated by abiotic and biotically induced (mainly microbial) precipitates. The sedimentation rates of all three factories decrease as the time span of observation increases. This scaling trend is not just an artifact of ratio correlation: it is almost certainly related to the episodic, pulsating nature of sedimentation. The growth potential of the three systems can be estimated by drawing the envelope of the maximum observed rates of aggradation. The tropical system shows the highest rates: 10 4 ♂m a -1 at 10 3 years, decreasing to 10 2 ♂m a -2 at 10 7 years. The maximum rates of the cool-water system are comparable to those of the tropical carbonates for intervals shorter than 2 x 10 5 years but they amount to only 25‰ of the tropical standard in the domain of 10 6-10 3 years. The high short-term rates of cool-water carbonates are probably caused by reworking and local trapping of sediment. The growth rates of the mud-mound system significantly exceed cool-water rates and rival the aggradation rates of tropical shallow-water carbonates. However, the mud-mound system exports less sediment that its tropical counterpart and is, therefore, somewhat less productive.},

The data were obtained by the glaciological reconstruction and homogeneous parameterization of the 1850 glacier situation in the Swiss Alps (the last advance period of the Little Ice Age). The statistical comparison with the present-day glaciation (recorded in 1973) provides for the first time a complete synopsis of various glaciological and geographical aspects of longterm glacier retreat in the period since 1850. Attempts were made, based on the new inventory data, to model potential ice decay scenarios for the Swiss Alps and to estimate the glaciological consequences of an enhanced atmospheric warming. Since the end of the Little Ice Age the mean vertical 2:1-ELA shift (AAR = 0.67) of glaciers with normal topographic characteristics is in the order of -90 m. This unfavourable change in mass balance conditions has led to a substantial glacier area loss in the Swiss Alps of approximataly 500 km2 (27 percent) and to an ice volume loss of 33 km (31 percent) The relative amount of ice-decay (area, volume, length) is highly variable on an individual scale but in general shows a significant inverse correlation with former glacier size. The simulation of different 2:1-ELA-rise scenarios outlines the high sensitivity of alpine glaciation in respect of future climate changes. A strongly accelerated but regionally differentiated glacier decay within the next few decades would be the result of the 21st century based atmospheric warming scenarios.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine the absence or lack of ground cover prior to the mid-Tertiary. We tested the hypothesis that different forms of ground cover existed in the past against examples from the Recent and the fossil record (Table 1). The Recent data were obtained from a large number of sources including those in the ecological, horticultural, and microbiological literature. Other data were derived from our knowledge of Precambrian life, sedimentology and paleosols, and the plant fossil record, especially in situ floras and fossil “monocultures.” Some of the data are original observations, but many others are from the literature.

abstract = {A 15-year climatology of surface fluxes from the 6-h forecasts provided by the ECMWF re-analysis (ERA 15) is assessed in the context of global ocean circulation modelling. The long-term mean forcing function defined by heat, freshwater and momentum surface fluxes is examined over the global ocean, and compared with other available data (satellite, in situ). This reveals significant global and regional biases in the ERA 15 surface fluxes. The short-wave radiative flux is generally underestimated within the intertropical band. However, a misrepresentation of marine stratus in the regions of subsidence of the Walker cell leads to an excess of short-wave radiation there. The meridional oceanic heat and freshwater transports are computed and compared with other estimates. It is found that some deficiencies in heat transport are related to the underestimate of the short-wave radiation within the tropics. The largest discrepancies between transport estimates generally appear in the Indian and the South Pacific oceans. The contribution of Ekman heat transport in the net meridional heat transport is also diagnosed using ERA 15 wind stress. This highlights the major role of the Ekman processes in transporting heat, mainly in tropical regions. Finally, a dynamic insight into the thermohaline forcing of ocean models with ERA 15 is provided by examining the haline and thermal surface density fluxes. The global biases in heat and freshwater fluxes are found to have a non-negligible impact on the spatial distribution of the density fluxes. It is concluded that the climatological ERA 15 surface fluxes need to be properly adjusted, especially in the tropics, in order to use them to force ocean models.

abstract = {The Bahamas Transect was designed to assess the response of the carbonate depositional system to sea-level changes and to evaluate the relationship between the sedimentary and oxygen isotope records of Neogene sea-level changes in order to establish a causal link between glacio-eustasy and the stratigraphic pattern. In addition, the timing of unconformity-bounded sequences and the question of chronostratigraphic significance of seismic sequence boundaries were of special interest. Cores from seven sites drilled during Leg 166 along the western Great Bahama Bank retrieved the sedimentary record and the timing of high- and low-frequency sea-level changes throughout the Neogene. Facies successions within the cores contain indications of sea-level changes on two different scales. First, there are high-frequency alternations between meter-thick layers with platform-derived material and thin layers with more pelagic sediments. Carbonate-rich intervals are interpreted to reflect periods of high sea level, whereas the thin intervals correspond to times of increased pelagic and siliciclastic input during sea-level lowstands. The duration of these alternations (20-40 k.y.) correlates with orbitally induced high-frequency climate and sea-level changes. Second, longer term sea-level changes with a duration of 0.5-2.0 m.y. are also recorded in slope deposits along the Great Bahama Bank. Alternating high (up to 20 cm/k.y.) and low (<2 cm/k.y.) sedimentation rates record a long-term pattern of bank flooding with concomitant shedding to the slopes as well as periods of bank exposure with reduced shallow-water carbonate production, upper slope erosion, and largely pelagic sedimentation in the basin. The longer term changes coincide with progradation pulses that are imaged on the seismic data as depositional sequences. The internal facies architecture of these carbonate depositional sequences displays five major elements. In the undathem, or the platform top, the sediments are arranged in shallow-water packages separated by exposure horizons. Thick bulges of the prograding pulses are characterized by fine-grained platform-derived material that accumulates on the upper slope. The middle to lower slope has a variable facies assemblage consisting of periplatform, pelagic, and redeposited carbonates. Small-scale channeling and lobes of turbidites produce irregular depositional surfaces. At the toe-of-slope, redeposited carbonates accumulate during both sea-level highstands and lowstands. These carbonate turbidite series are arranged in mounded lobes with feeder channels. The distal portion of the sequences is dominated by cyclic marl/limestone alternations with few turbidites. The ages of the 17 observed Neogene seismic sequence boundaries yielded an excellent correlation between sites, documenting the age consistency of the sequence boundaries and chronostratigraphic significance of the seismic reflections. The ages of the sequences along the Bahamas Transect provide a data set that, in conjunction with data sets from other margins, will eventually solve the question about global synchronous longer term sea-level changes. A comparison between the sedimentary and isotope records reveals a discrepancy in the frequency of sea-level changes. Oxygen isotopes record sea-level changes at an obliquity frequency, whereas resistivity and gamma-ray values record sea-level changes dominated by orbital precession. These precessional cycles are packaged into longer term cycles of eccentricity (100, 400, and 2000 k.y.).},

However, there are considerable uncertainties in our estimates of many other forcing mechanisms; those associated with the so-called indirect aerosol forcing (whereby changes in aerosols can impact on cloud properties) may be the most serious, as its climatic effect may be of a similar size as, but opposite sign to, that due to carbon dioxide.

We find that the thermal mode, typical of climates such as our own, is unlikely to support deep-sea anoxia. The haline mode which might exixt in warm climates with enchanced hydrological cycles, can lead to significant but periodic depletion in the Panthalassic deep ocean.

Via sieving methods, the grains are separated and a weight-based size distribution constructed. Various moment parameters are computed from the size distribution and these serve as sediment characteristics. This paper examines the feasibility of a fully electronic granularity analysis using digital image processing. The study uses a random model of three-dimensional grains in conjunction with the morphological method of granulometric size distributions. The random model is constructed to simulate sand, silt, and clay particle distributions. Owing to the impossibility of perfectly sifting small grains so that they do not touch, the model is used in both disjoint and non-disjoint modes, and watershed segmentation is applied in the non-disjoint model. The image-based granulometric size distributions are transformed so that they take into account the necessity to view sediment fractions at different magnifications and in different frames. Gray-scale granulometric moments are then computed using both ordinary and reconstructive granulometries. The resulting moments are then compared to moments found from real grains in seven different sediments using standard weight-based size distributions.},

Its magnitude is proportional to the square of the wind speed, which is also affected by the roughness of the sea-surface and conditions in the overlying atmosphere. Wind stress acting on the sea-surface generates motion in the form of waves and currents. The surface current is typically 3% of the wind speed. Motion is transmitted downwards through frictional coupling caused by turbulence. The currents that result when the horizontal pressure gradient force is balanced by the Coriolis force are known as geostrophic currents. The ocean is full of eddies. They originate from perturbations in the mean flow, and their formation has the overall effect of transferring energy from the mean flow. Current flow around most mesoscale eddies is in approximate geostrophic equilibrium. They are known to form from meanders in intense frontal regions like the Gulf Stream and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current,},

abstract = {The skeletal growth rates of late Cretaceous rudist bivalves have been inferred from cyclic variations of isotopic and chemical compositions which are found in sclerochronological profiles of outer shell layers. Annual shell accretion of 11 studied shells from different environmental settings was in the range of less than 10 to 54 mm. CaCO 3 production of individual rudists was calculated to range from 12 to 214 g a -1, and estimates of annual production of rudists communities assuming dense growth fabrics range from 4.6 to 28.5 kg m -2. These production rates are not significantly higher when compared to modern mussel or oyster beds but, in contrast to modern analogues, rudist associations were much more important for the sedimentary budget of low-latitude shallow-water depositional environments. Controlling factors for the formation of growth fabrics and carbonate production are evaluated in a case study of rudist formations from a single depositional sequence. From turbulent outer platform environments to lagoonal inner platform settings, a decrease both in carbonate production and size of shells was found among specimens of a single species. No differences in carbonate production are evident when carbonate production in siliciclastic and calcareous environment environments is compared. Potential feedbacks between rudists and their environment induced by vertical growth, large production of bioclastic sediment and ejected biodeposits are discussed.},

abstract = {The Cretaceous is often thought of as a warm version of the modern Earth. There was no ice on the poles and, except for the Sevier Highlands of western North America, no high mountains to divert the zonal flow of the winds. As a result the overall climate was more equable. Forced by steady equatorial trade winds, mid-latitude westerlies, and high-latitude easterly winds, the circulation in the Panthalassic Ocean would have been similar to the that of the modern Pacific, A low-latitude circumglobal seaway, the Tethys, separated the northern Laurasian continents from the Gondwanan continents of the south. Past studies of the Cretaceous Ocean have assumed a direct analogy with the modern Earth and its climatology. Only the widespread deposition of organic-carbon-rich black shales in the deep sea has caused paleoceanographers to suspect that something was very different. Here, I propose that the Cretaceous was very different from the modern world. The ice-free condition caused seasonal variations of atmospheric pressure in the polar regions and destabilized the winds at mid-and high latitudes. Without steady westerly winds the subtropical and polar frontal systems in the ocean and the sharp stratification of the low-latitude ocean disappeared. There were no barriers to meridional ocean heat transport. Not only was there flooding of the continental blocks, but there was a doubling of the area of deep marginal seas and a quadrupling of the area of shallow seas. In particular, the area of shallow shelf seas of the arid zone along the northern Tethyan margin was an order of magnitude larger than those in similar latitudes today. Evaporation would have provided many sources of saline waters of different density to the Tethys and Atlantic regions. The overall aspect of the Tethyan circumglobal seaway was similar to the modern North Atlantic, with many competing sources of interior waters.},

abstract = {Major hydrocarbon reservoirs from North Africa are located in the Cambro-Ordovician sandstones, which partly originate from a glacial environment (Late Ordovician). In several intracratonic basins of North Africa, like the Sbaa Basin (Algeria), glacial Ordovician deposits are well developed (150 to 300m thick). These deposits are composed of very fine to coarse-grained sandstones, locally intercalated with clayous siltstones. Glacial Ordovician sandstones display high lateral and vertical variations of porosity and permeability, mostly controlled by burial diagenetic processes, and in a lesser extent by sedimentary facies. Although many aspects of sandstone diagenesis are well-studied, the character and processes of glacial-associated diagenesis remain unknown. Therefore, the main objectives of this thesis are (i) to assess the diagenetic history of Cambro- Ordovician sandstones of the Sbaa Basin, (ii) to understand the structural and sedimentological control on diagenesis, and (iii) to determine and quantify the role of diagenesis on the reservoir poro-perm evolution. To address these problems, multiple analyses were conducted on drill-core samples of the Sbaa Basin: Petrographic analyses allowed the identification, characterization, and classification of diagenetic processes. The main diagenetic processes affecting the reservoir are: quartz cementation, chemical compaction, detrital feldspar dissolution, clay coating around detrital quartz grains, smectite illitization, and authigenesis of illite, dickite, calcite, siderite, and pyrite. Microthermometric analyses of fluid inclusions within quartz overgrowths demonstrate that quartz cementation began at approximately 100°C, and gradually continued during burial to temperatures as high as 160°C. According to the thermal history of the basin, this temperature range indicates that cementation occurred during the Visean-Namurian burial phase. Silica sources correspond to stylolitization, intergranular quartz dissolution, feldspar dissolution, and smectite illitization. Three phases of quartz cement were evident from cathodoluminescence and microprobe analyses. Each phase contains distinct Al content, partly related to the associated silica source. Fluid evolution was determined by isotopic analyses on early and late authigenic minerals (siderite, calcite, quartz, and dickite). Results indicate the influence of early meteoric water, gradually heated during burial, and progressively enriched in 18O due to interactions with the host rock. Dickite is observed within or close to microfractures in the Ordovician sandstones. At the field scale, dickite is observed only in fractured wells and is more abundant in the clay fraction close to the Silurian source- rock. Fracture features (location and orientation) in Ordovician sandstones are related to the Hercynian orogeny. Dickite develops in acidic conditions. Tectonic activity and fracturation related to the Hercynian orogeny probably triggered acidic fluids migration from the organic-rich Silurian shales into the Ordovician sandstones. This pattern leads to authigenic clay zonations in Ordovician sandstones, in particular with the development of dickite within and close to fractures, while illite is formed in non-fractured areas. Dickite cements have less destructive effect on permeability than illite cements. Therefore, the relationship between fracturation and dickite development provides a good proxy for the prediction of reservoir quality. Quartz cementation and intergranular quartz dissolution (also called « pressure dissolution ») are mainly responsible for porosity and permeability destruction within the studied reservoir. This study highlights the major influence of synsedimentary glaciogenic processes on the distribution and the importance of both diagenetic phenomena. Indeed, illite coatings around detrital quartz are systematically located below glacial pavements that separate two sandstone facies of glacial units with low clay contents. These clay coatings were mechanically emplaced below the ice sheet by pressurized water circulation and subsequent fluid pressure release within sandy subglacial soft bedrock that was initially porous and permeable. This process did not occur if an argillaceous layer (acting as a permeability barrier) was intercalated between the glacial pavement and the sandy layer. The clay coatings occurence will determine afterwards diagenetic evolution of these sandstones by enhancing chemical compaction (intergranular quartz dissolution), and inhibiting quartz cementation or decreasing the rate of precipitation. Silica produced by intergranular quartz dissolution was then exported and precipitated within more porous levels where chemical compaction is low. Therefore, the organization of the glacial lithofacies controls the diagenetic architecture and petrophysical properties of the reservoir. This relationship explains the present reservoir quality distribution, and differentiates between the lower part (tight) and the upper part (conventional) of the glacial Ordovician reservoir.},

The Red Hill site in Pennsylvania, US, provides a range of information about the physical and biotic setting of a floodplain ecosystem along the southern margin of the Euramerican landmass during the late Famennian age. An avulsion model for floodplain sedimentation is favoured in which a variety of inter-channel depositional settings formed a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial habitats. The Red Hill flora demonstrates ecological partitioning of the floodplain landscape at a high taxonomic level. In addition to progymnosperm forests, lycopsid wetlands and zygopterid fern glades, the flora includes patches of early spermatophytes occupying sites disturbed by fires. The Red Hill fauna illustrates the development of a diverse penecontemporaneous community including terrestrial invertebrates and a wide range of vertebrates that were living within aquatic habitats. Among the vertebrates are several limbed tetrapodomorphs that inhabited the burgeoning shallow water habitats on the floodplain. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Geological Society of London.},

abstract = {The adjoint of an ocean general circulation model is at the heart of the ocean state estimation system of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) project. As part of an ongoing effort to extend ECCO to a coupled ocean/sea-ice estimation system, a dynamic and thermodynamic sea-ice model has been developed for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). One key requirement is the ability to generate, by means of automatic differentiation (AD), tangent linear (TLM) and adjoint (ADM) model code for the coupled MITgcm ocean/sea-ice system. This second part of a two-part paper describes aspects of the adjoint model. The adjoint ocean and sea-ice model is used to calculate transient sensitivities of solid (ice and snow) freshwater export through Lancaster Sound in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA). The adjoint state provides a complementary view of the dynamics. In particular, the transient, multi-year sensitivity patterns reflect dominant pathways and propagation timescales through the CAA as resolved by the model, thus shedding light on causal relationships, in the model, across the Archipelago. The computational cost of inferring such causal relationships from forward model diagnostics alone would be prohibitive. The role of the exact model trajectory around which the adjoint is calculated (and therefore of the exactness of the adjoint) is exposed through calculations using free-slip vs no-slip lateral boundary conditions. Effective ice thickness, sea surface temperature, and precipitation sensitivities, are discussed in detail as examples of the coupled sea-ice/ocean and atmospheric forcing control space. To test the reliability of the adjoint, finite-difference perturbation experiments were performed for each of these elements and the cost perturbations were compared to those " predicted" by the adjoint. Overall, remarkable qualitative and quantitative agreement is found. In particular, the adjoint correctly " predicts" a seasonal sign change in precipitation sensitivities. A physical mechanism for this sign change is presented. The availability of the coupled adjoint opens up the prospect for adjoint-based coupled ocean/sea-ice state estimation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Human activities have strong impacts on ecosystem functioning through their effect on abiotic factors and on biodiversity. There is also growing evidence that species functional traits link changes in species composition and shifts in ecosystem processes. Hence, it appears to be of utmost importance to quantify modifications in the functional structure of species communities after human disturbance in addition to changes in taxonomie structure. Despite this fact, there is still little consensus on the actual impacts of human-mediated habitat alteration on the components of biodiversity, which include species functional traits. Therefore, we studied changes in taxonomic diversity (richness and evenness), in functional diversity, and in functional specialization of estuarine fish communities facing drastic environmental and habitat alterations. The Terminos Lagoon (Gulf of Mexico) is a tropical estuary of primary concern for its biodiversity, its habitats, and its resource supply, which have been severely impacted by human activities. Fish communities were sampled in four zones of the Terminos Lagoon 18 years apart (1980 and 1998). Two functions performed by fish (food acquisition and locomotion) were studied through the measurement of 16 functional traits. Functional diversity of fish communities was quantified using three independent components: richness, evenness, and divergence. Additionally, we measured the degree of functional specialization in fish communities. We used a null model to compare the functional and the taxonomic structure of fish communities between 1980 and 1998. Among the four largest zones studied, three did not show strong functional changes. In the northern part of the lagoon, we found an increase in fish richness but a significant decrease of functional divergence and functional specialization. We explain this result by a decline of specialized species (i.e., those with particular combinations of traits), while newly occurring species are redundant with those already present. The species that decreased in abundance have functional traits linked to seagrass habitats that regressed consecutively to increasing eutrophication. The paradox found in our study highlights the need for a multifaceted approach in the assessment of biodiversity changes in communities under pressure. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Orogenesis is principally due to accretion of arc terranes and/or ribbon microcontinents. Most arc terranes are ensialic and separated from the adjacent continents by backarc or marginal basins, the episodic closure of which commonly was responsible for orogenesis. Little evidence is preserved for true intra-oceanic juvenile arcs during the Early to Middle Ordovician. Instead, subduction appears to have been localized near the margins of Laurentia, Gondwana, Baltica, and Siberia, forming extensive linear orogenic belts during relatively short periods when the upper plate switched from extension to compression. Such tectonic switching appears to have taken place along the entire length of the Pacific and Iapetan margins of Gondwana (>10,000 km) from Middle-Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician time. The onset of orogenesis along Gondwana's Pacific margin during the end of the Early Cambrian (ca. 513 Ma) coincided with subduction initiation along both margins of the Iapetus Ocean. Orogenesis and subduction initiation are causally related to a global-scale plate reorganization, probably induced by terminal amalgamation of Gondwana. During the Paleozoic, Laurentia's Iapetan margin steadily grew in size and expanded southward owing to continuous accretion of suprasubduction zone oceanic crust, peri-Gondwanan arc terranes, and ribbon microcontinents. In contrast, the Pacific, Iapetan, and Rheic margins of Gondwana saw little addition of new, allochthonous crust. Accretion mainly involves reattachment of previously rifted-off arc terranes and small slivers of the intervening marginal basin crust. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Geological Society of America.

abstract = {Fostering team innovation is increasingly an important leadership function. However, the empirical evidence for the role of transformational leadership in engendering team innovation is scarce and mixed. To address this issue, the authors link transformational leadership theory to principles of M. A. West's (1990) team climate theory and propose an integrated model for the relationship between transformational leadership and team innovation. This model involves support for innovation as a mediating process and climate for excellence as a moderator. Results from a study of 33 research and development teams confirmed that transformational leadership works through support for innovation, which in turn interacts with climate for excellence such that support for innovation enhances team innovation only when climate for excellence is high.},

abstract = {New data and review of classic sections from the Middle and Upper Ordovician North American Midcontinent in the Upper Mississippi Valley provide a refi ned picture of the age, stable isotope geochemistry, faunal composition, and—ultimately— origin of this epeiric ramp succession. Sequence stratigraphic analysis reveals a series of unconformity-bounded, genetically related facies packages. Shallowing and deepening trends are sometimes diffi cult to resolve due to a paucity of hydrodynamic indicators, yet unconformity surfaces are well marked by hardgrounds and confi rmed by nega-tive C-isotope spikes. Recent conodont biostratigraphy, new U-Pb radioisotopic ages for K-bentonites, and correlation of C-isotope profi les to global trends suggest that the succession spans the Darriwilian to Hirnantian epochs. Focus on Platteville to lower Galena Group strata (Sandbian to early Katian) provides a temporally high-resolution look at the onset and evolution of a long-term (>2 m.y.) positive carbon-isotope excur-sion, short-term perturbations in that record, and relationship to the preservation and diversity of the enclosed fauna and strata. Major changes in authigenic mineral suites and organic carbon content throughout the Upper Ordovician Upper Mississippi Val-ley suggest at least three major redox cycles. The combined evidence for globally rec-ognized, positive carbon-isotope excursions coincident with these redox cycles, as well as high-frequency, sea-level fl uctuations and successive faunal turnover events, sug-gests far-fi eld responses to multiple global oceanic anoxic events.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The present day Variscan basement areas of Europe have been recognized as generally derived from Gondwana, based on fauna, facies and detrital zircons distributions. These areas represent only a portion of Europe (Iberia, France, Central Europe), but it is obvious that similar Variscan basements are present in the whole Alpine and Mediterranean areas too, up to the Caucasus. In tracing these terranes back to their possible position around Gondwana, it became obvious that they could not all be positioned north of Africa, as generally shown on reconstructions. We developed the concept of a ribbon like Galatian superterrane that comprised most of these “European” Variscan elements. In Ordovician times, this superterrane extended from the north of South America to South China (located in continuity to Africa). Along such a length, the geodynamic evolution was not the same, but presents strong similarities. Geodynamic scenarios for the whole Paleozoic have been developed for the different segments, thus allowing us to re-distribute the subterranes in a coherent way. The diachronous openings of the Rheic s.l. ocean, then of the Paleotethys, represent the main reconstruction guidelines, together with major magmatic activity distribution in space and time.},

abstract = { The geographic distribution of 293 Modern bivalve genera has been analyzed and found to be statistically correlated with distance. In particular, a least-squares regression analysis of the data indicates that the distance between faunal realms ( D ) in kilometers can be estimated using the equation D = (ln( d ) + 0.4233)/−0.00013, where d is the Dice coefficient of faunal similarity. Analysis of 59 genera of Late Ordovician bivalves indicates that the above equation also describes their biogeographic distribution. Using this formula, the distance between Laurentia and Scotland/Northwest Ireland was estimated to be 5500 kilometers. This is consistent with the reconstruction of a connection among these areas during the Late Ordovician based on brachiopod and graptolite biogeographic data.Paleomagnetic and paleoclimatic data also suggest that Avalonia, Baltica, and Laurentia were at tropical latitudes. Distances between these paleocontinents can therefore be used to estimate paleolongitudes. If the location of England on the eastern side of Avalonia is used as zero degrees paleolongitude for the Late Ordovician as it is today, the paleolongitude for South America, Laurentia, Scotland and northwest Ireland, and Baltica would be 125°W, 45°W, 10°W, and 15°E, respectively. Because of drifting of the Avalonia plate, these paleolongitudes probably do not coincide with the longitudinal grid used today. The paleolongitudes indicate only the relative spacing between continents in the past. The methodology in this study should be useful for improving the accuracy of paleogeographic reconstructions for the Late Ordovician throughout the Cenozoic, and especially the Paleozoic periods for which magnetic seafloor anomaly data are not available.},

The century this may be a century of human intelligence, and excellence will be a community that works on the development of thinking of its members. We live in an age characterized by the wealth of scientific and modern technology, and this requires multiple methods of thinking to confront them and try to overcome them. Our vehicle for this is science, science and knowledge are power have become the new world. The building and personal growth of normal primary objectives of the educational process, and each individual's unique and distinctive character which is different from the other individuals. So the current is determined by the importance of research, known ways of thinking's favorite (Sternberg), the extension educators and its relationship to pattern their characters. Target current research to answer the following questions: 1- What ways of thinking favored by Educational counselors in light of the theory (Asternberg) to ways of thinking. 2- Is there a statistically significant correlation between ways of thinking in the light of the theory (Asternberg), Educational counselors in the pattern of their personality (extraversion - introversion), and (neuroticism - stability). To achieve the objectives of the research, the researcher tools are: a list of ways of thinking for (Sternberg) short list, a list (Eisenk) to personal style, and After finding the psychometrical properties for the criterion as, a sample (100) counselors has been tested chosen randomly out of the whole group of counselors (143) who work in secondary and intermediate schools in the General Directorate of Education in Kirkuk. After processing the data concisely using the (t-test, on sample and two samples, the person factor device ). The study comes up with the following conclusion: 1- The most favored ways of thinking among members of the sample are ways of thinking (hierarchical, liberal, estoppel, PLC). 2- there was no statistically significant relationships between overlapping ways of thinking according to the theory (Sternberg), and personal style according to the theory (Eisenk), for members of the research sample, except in the two methods are the only two methods (local and Royal). We conclude from this that there are relationships between the function's ways of thinking (Sternberg), and personal characteristics. In light of these results, the researcher recommends taking advantage of the tools in the development of outreach programs develop positive ways of thinking and patterns of personal individuals.

abstract = {The Cenomanian-Turonian oceanic anoxic event (OAE2) is characterized by large perturbations in the oxygen and sulfur cycles of the ocean, potentially resulting from changes in oxygen supply (via oxygen solubility and ocean circulation) and in marine productivity. We assess the relative impact of these mechanisms, comparing model experiments with a new compilation of observations for seafloor dysoxia/anoxia and photic zone euxinia. The model employed is an intermediate-complexity Earth system model which accounts for the main ocean dynamics and biogeochemistry of the Cretaceous climate. The impact of higher temperature and marine productivity is evaluated in the model as a result of higher atmospheric carbon dioxide and oceanic nutrient concentrations. The model shows that temperature is not alone able to reproduce the observed patterns of oceanic redox changes associated with OAE2. Observations are reproduced in the model mainly via enhanced marine productivity due to higher nutrient content (responsible for 85% of the change). Higher phosphate content could have been sustained by increased chemical weathering and phosphorus regeneration from anoxic sediments, which in turn induced an enhanced nitrogen nutrient content of the ocean via nitrogen fixation. The model also shows that the presence of seafloor anoxia, as suggested by black-shale deposition in the proto-North Atlantic Ocean before the event, might be the result of the silled shape and lack of deep-water formation of this basin at the Late Cretaceous. Overall our model-data comparison shows that OAE2 anoxia was quasi-global spreading from 5% of the ocean volume before the event to at least 50% during OAE2. {\textcopyright} 2012.

However, description of biogeographical patterns of Ordovician Radiolaria is hampered by the paucity of known occurrences as well as possible taphonomic influences. The distribution of all known assemblages is analysed in time and space. Lower Ordovician (especially Tremadocian) Radiolaria are known from two distinct tropical localities of Laurentia. Geographical coverage is much better for the Middle Ordovician (Darriwilian). However, data are concentrated in tropical palaeolatitudes (between 308N and 308S). The absence of data from mid/high-latitude localities limits any biogeographical insights. In addition to this there are taphonomic and taxonomic biases. Data are also sparse for the Upper Ordovician. However, comparison between Australian and Nevadan material of Katian age shows strong similarities, suggesting the presence of a coherent tropical radiolarian bioprovince, as in the modern ocean. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Geological Society of London.},

abstract = {Palaeobiogeographical data on Cambrian trilobites obtained during the twentieth century are combined in this paper to evaluate palaeoceanographic links through c. 30 myr, once these arthropods biomineralized. Worldwide major tectonostratigraphic units are characterized at series intervals of Cambrian time and datasets of trilobite genera (629 for Cambrian Series 2, 965 for Cambrian Series 3, and 866 for the Furongian Series) are analysed using parsimony analysis of endemicity. Special attention is given to the biogeographical observations made in microcontinents and exotic terranes. The same is done for platform-basinal transects of well-known continental margins. The parsimony analysis of endemicity analysis resulted in distinct palaeogeographical area groupings among the tectonostratigraphic units. With these groupings, several palaeobiogeographical units are distinguished, which do not necessarily fit the previously proposed biogeographical realms and provinces. Their development and spatial distributions are broadly controlled by Cambrian palaeoclimates, palaeogeographical conditions (e.g. carbonate productivity and anoxic conditions) and ocean current circulation.{\textcopyright}The Geological Society of London 2013.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In human heart failure beta-adrenergic-mediated protein kinase A (PKA) activity is down-regulated, while protein kinase C (PKC) activity is up-regulated. PKC-mediated myofilament protein phosphorylation might be detrimental for contractile function in cardiomyopathy. This study was designed to reveal the effects of PKC on myofilament function in human myocardium under basal conditions and upon modulation of protein phosphorylation by PKA and phosphatases. METHODS: Isometric force was measured at different [Ca(2+)] in single permeabilized cardiomyocytes from non-failing and failing human left ventricular tissue. Basal phosphorylation of myofilament proteins and the influence of PKC, PKA, and phosphatase treatments were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, Western immunoblotting, and ELISA. RESULTS: Troponin I (TnI) phosphorylation at the PKA sites was decreased in failing compared to non-failing hearts and correlated well with myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity (pCa(50)). Incubation with the catalytic domain of PKC slightly decreased maximal force under basal conditions, but not following PKA and phosphatase pretreatments. PKC reduced Ca(2+) sensitivity to a larger extent in failing (DeltapCa(50)=0.19+/-0.03) than in non-failing (DeltapCa(50)=0.08+/-0.01) cardiomyocytes. This shift was reduced, though still significant, when PKC was preceded by PKA, while PKA following PKC did not further decrease pCa(50). Protein analysis indicated that PKC phosphorylated PKA sites in human TnI and increased phosphorylation of troponin T, while myosin light chain phosphorylation remained unaltered. CONCLUSION: In human myocardium PKC-mediated myofilament protein phosphorylation only has a minor effect on maximal force development. The PKC-mediated decrease in Ca(2+) sensitivity may serve to improve diastolic function in failing human myocardium in which PKA-mediated TnI phosphorylation is decreased.},

abstract = {The well-known Variscan basement areas of Europe contain relic terranes with a pre-Variscan evolution testifying to their peri-Gondwanan origin (e.g., relics of Neoproterozoic volcanic arcs, and subsequent stages of accretionary wedges, backarc rifting, and spreading). The evolution of these terranes was guided by the diachronous subduction of the proto-Tethys oceanic ridge under different segments of the Gondwana margin. This subduction triggered the emplacement of magmatic bodies and the formation of backarc rifts, some of which became major oceanic realms (Rheic, paleo- Tethys). Consequently, the drifting of Avalonia was followed, after the Silurian and a short Ordovician orogenic event, by the drifting of Armorica and Alpine domains, accompanied by the opening of the paleo-Tethys. The slab rollback of the Rheic ocean is viewed as the major mechanism for the drifting of the European Variscan terranes. This, in turn, generated a large slab pull force responsible for the opening of major rift zones within the passive Eurasian margin. Therefore, the first Middle Devonian Variscan orogenic event is viewed as the result of a collision between terranes detached from Gondwana (grouped as the Hun superterrane) and terranes detached from Eurasia. Subsequently, the amalgamated terranes collided with Eurasia in a second Variscan orogenic event in Visean time, accompanied by large-scale lateral escape of major parts of the accreted margin. Final collision of Gondwana with Laurussia did not take place before Late Carboniferous time and was responsible for the Alleghanian orogeny.},

abstract = {The widespread development of anoxic and dysoxic deposition in marine settings occurred during the Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) transition interval. Facies varied according to paleobathymetry and paleolatitude. Thus, dark gray, uranium-enriched shales characterize deeper shelf locations over wide areas of northern Boreal seas, whereas the oceanic record consists of condensed, organic-rich, black shales. Finely laminated, pyrite-rich, micritic mudstones occur in equatorial Tethyan sections. Contemporaneous dolomitization in many shallow-marine settings provides further indirect evidence for widespread P-Tr anoxia. Similarly, common reports of unusual stromatolites in the earliest Triassic Griesbachian Stage could reflect the widespread occurrence of direct calcite precipitation from carbonate-saturated anoxic bottom waters. Oxygen-poor conditions are first recorded from the Late Permian, deep-water, accreted oceanic terranes of Japan. Such conditions vastly increased in extent in the interval between the latest Permian and the late Griesbachian, when dysaerobic facies developed in all but the shallowest of marine settings. The Panthalassa ocean was probably truly euxinic in this interval. Anoxia was never so extensive or so intense after this interval, and the superanoxic event ceased abruptly in equatorial Tethyan latitudes in the latest Griesbachian. Elsewhere, anoxia persisted at least into the Dienerian Stage in the Perigondwanan shelf sections of the Neo-Tethys, and deep-water anoxia may have persisted in Panthalassa until the middle Triassic.},

abstract = {Two of the greatest evolutionary events in the history of life on Earth occurred during Early Paleozoic time. The first was the Cambrian explosion of skeletonized marine animals about 540 million years ago. The second was the "Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event," which is the focus of this book. During the 46-million-year Ordovician Period (489--443 m.y.), a bewildering array of adaptive radiations of "Paleozoic- and Modern-type" biotas appeared in marine habitats, the first animals (arthropods) walked on land, and the first non-vascular bryophyte-like plants (based on their cryptospore record) colonized terrestrial areas with damp environments. This book represents a compilation by a large team of Ordovician specialists from around the world, who have enthusiastically cooperated to produce this first globally orientated, internationally sponsored IGCP (International Geological Correlation Program) project on Ordovician biotas. The major part is an assembly of genus- and species-level diversity data for the many Ordovician fossil groups. The book also presents an evaluation of how each group diversified through Ordovician time, with assessments of patterns of change and rates of origination and extinction. As such, it will become the standard work and data source for biotic studies on the Ordovician Period.},

abstract = {We hypothesize that secular evolution in the control of calcium carbonate deposition dictated the severity of Neoproterozoic ice ages. In the modem ocean, reduction in carbonate deposition on the continental shelves can be compensated for by the increased preservation in deep sea sediments of biogenic carbonate originating from planktic calcifiers living in the open ocean. The result is that ocean carbonate chemistry is strongly buffered and the carbon-climate system relatively stable. How-ever, before the advent of metazoan biomineralization in the Cambrian and proliferation of calcareous plankton during the Mesozoic, carbonate deposition would have been largely restricted to shallow water photic environments in the Neoproterozoic. A fall in sea level acting to restrict the photosynthetic area within Precambrian seas would necessarily initially decrease the global rate of carbonate deposition without being compensated by the typical Phanerozoic deep sea sedimentary ‘buffer'. Ultimately, carbonate precipitation would reestablish itself at a greater local rate throughout the more areally restricted seas. The resulting higher degree of ocean saturation translates to substantially lower atmospheric CO2 and colder terrestrial conditions. Ice ages of near-global extent and multi million-year duration can thus be understood as a direct consequence of the weak ‘buffering' of the Precambrian carbon cycle, amplified by feedbacks involving CO2 and climate. Both the widespread occurrence and observed thickness of ‘cap' (dolostone) carbonate deposited during postglacial flooding of the shelves are explicit predictions of this hypothesis, and record the rapid removal from a highly oversaturated ocean of excess alkalinity accumulated during the glacial.},

abstract = {The monthly mean shortwave (SW) radiation budget at the Earth's surface (SRB) was computed on 2.5 degree longitude-latitude resolution for the 17-year period from 1984 to 2000, using a radiative transfer model accounting for the key physical parameters that determine the surface SRB, and long-term climatological data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP-D2). The model input data were supplemented by data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction - National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) and European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Global Reanalysis projects, and other global data bases such as TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and Global Aerosol Data Set (GADS). The model surface radiative fluxes were validated against surface measurements from 22 stations of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) covering the years 1992-2000, and from 700 stations of the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA), covering the period 1984-2000. The model is in good agreement with BSRN and GEBA, with a negative bias of 14 and 6.5 Wm-2, respectively. The model is able to reproduce interesting features of the seasonal and geographical variation of the surface SW fluxes at global scale. Based on the 17-year average model results, the global mean SW downward surface radiation (DSR) is equal to 171.6 Wm-2, whereas the net downward (or absorbed) surface SW radiation is equal to 149.4 Wm-2, values that correspond to 50.2 and 43.7% of the incoming SW radiation at the top of the Earth's atmosphere. These values involve a long-term surface albedo equal to 12.9%. Significant increasing trends in DSR and net DSR fluxes were found, equal to 4.1 and 3.7 Wm-2, respectively, over the 1984-2000 period (equivalent to 2.4 and 2.2 Wm-2 per decade), indicating an increasing surface solar radiative heating. This surface SW radiative heating is primarily attributed to clouds, especially low-level, and secondarily to other parameters such as total precipitable water. The surface solar heating occurs mainly in the period starting from the early 1990s, in contrast to decreasing trend in DSR through the late 1980s. The computed global mean DSR and net DSR flux anomalies were found to range within ±8 and ±6 Wm-2, respectively, with signals from El N{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events, and the Pinatubo eruption, whereas significant positive anomalies have occurred in the period 1992-2000. {\textcopyright} 2005 Author(s).

Often the argument has been, first, that vegetated dunes are fixed relicts, and second, that fixed dunes indicate past aridity. Recent work suggests that neither of these maxims is necessarily true. Using the example of the linear dunes of southern Africa, this paper examines the extent to which we can continue to support a simple assumption that vegetated dunes are inactive relicts. In particular, it addresses the problem of what constitutes activity on linear dunes, and suggests some hypotheses for investigating the ‘grey' area between active, unvegetated dunes and densely wooded, inactive dunes. The concept of episodic activity is introduced in the context of partially vegetated linear dune forms. },

abstract = {We have identified a novel cell-matrix interaction in activated osteoclasts. Resorbing osteoclasts maintain a barrier adjacent to the bone surface that prevents the leakage of secreted protons and proteases from the resorption area. Using a series of fluorescent dyes of known molecular mass and different surface charge we established that negatively charged molecules with M(r )up to 10,000 rapidly accumulate underneath actively resorbing osteoclasts. Live cell imaging shows that staining could be detected underneath the osteoclasts as early as 30 seconds after the addition of the low molecular mass markers. We provide evidence that the actin cytoskeleton and the adhesion substrate in contact with the cells are critically involved in the maintenance of the sealing barrier. These data taken together suggest that the accumulation under resorbing osteoclasts is by diffusion rather than transcytotic delivery. Our results indicate that the net concentration of secreted and resorbed components is a balance between generation rate and limited diffusion rather than the presence of an impermeable barrier as previously suggested. This dynamic osteoclast sealing zone may, thus, provide the mechanism by which osteoclast migration and resorption can occur simultaneously.},

Evidence for early colonisa- tion is poor, but the fossil record reveals that by mid- Palaeozoic times, complex terrestrial ecosystems had become established. The first phase of land colonisation by organisms may have started in the Precambrian, some 2.6 gigaannums (Ga) ago, in the form of microbially boundalluvialsands.Thesecondphasebeganinearnestin Ordovician times, when early land plants, in the form of bryophyte-like spores, first appear in the fossil record.

abstract = {The Late Ordovician (Hirnantian) glaciation is examined through the North Gondwana record. This domain extended from southern high palaeo-latitudes (southeastern Mauritania, Niger) to northern lower palaeo-latitudes (Morocco, Turkey) and covered a more than 4000 km-wide section perpendicular to ice-flow lines. A major mid-Hirnantian deglaciation event subdividing the Hirnantian glaciation in two first-order cycles is recognised. As best illustrated by the glacial record in western Libya, each cycle comprises 2–3 glacial phases separated by ice-front retreats several hundreds kilometres to the south. From ice-proximal to ice-distal regions, the number of glacial surfaces differentiates (i) a continental interior with post-glacial reworking of the glacial surfaces), (ii) a glaciated continental shelf that is subdivided into inner (1–2 surfaces), middle (2–5 surfaces) and outer (a single surface related to the glacial maximum) glaciated shelves, and (iii) the non-glaciated shelf. Ice-stream-generated glacial troughs, 50–200 km in width, cross-cut these domains. These troughs are zones of preferential glacial erosion and subsequent sediment accumulation. A glacial depositional sequence, bounded by two glacial erosion surfaces, records one glacial phase. The position either within or outside a glacial trough controls the stratigraphic architecture of a glacial sequence. Glaciomarine outwash diamictites are developed at or near the maximum position of the ice-front. During ice-sheet recession, and in an ice-stream-generated trough, a relatively thin sediment cover blankets the foredeepened erosion surface. An initial rapid ice-sheet withdrawal is inferred. Marine-terminating ice fronts then evolve later into more slowly retreating, land-terminating ice fronts. In adjacent inter-stream areas where a more gradual ice-sheet recession occurred, fluvioglacial deposits prevailed. The progradation of a delta-shelf system, coeval with fluvial aggradation, that may be locally interrupted by a period of isostatic rebound, characterises the late glacial retreat to interglacial conditions. This model should facilitate the sequence stratigraphic interpretation of Late Ordovician glacial deposits and other ancient glacial successions.},

abstract = {Mineral dust aerosols in the atmosphere have the potential to affect the global climate by influencing the radiative balance of the atmosphere and the supply of micronutrients to the ocean. Ice and marine sediment cores indicate that dust deposition from the atmosphere was at some locations 2-20 times greater during glacial periods, raising the possibility that mineral aerosols might have contributed to climate change on glacial-interglacial time scales. To address this question, we have used linked terrestrial biosphere, dust source, and atmospheric transport models to simulate the dust cycle in the atmosphere for current and last glacial maximum (LGM) climates. We obtain a 2.5-fold higher dust loading in the entire atmosphere and a twenty-fold higher loading in high latitudes, in LGM relative to present. Comparisons to a compilation of atmospheric dust deposition flux estimates for LGM and present in marine sediment and ice cores show that the simulated flux ratios are broadly in agreement with observations; differences suggest where further improvements in the simple dust model could be made. The simulated increase in high-latitude dustiness depends on the expansion of unvegetated areas, especially in the high latitudes and in central Asia, caused by a combination of increased aridity and low atmospheric [CO2]. The existence of these dust source areas at the LGM is supported by pollen data and loess distribution in the northern continents. These results point to a role for vegetation feedbacks, including climate effects and physiological effects of low [CO2], in modulating the atmospheric distribution of dust.

abstract = {Palaeodiversity curves are constructed from counts of fossils collected at outcrop and thus potentially biased by variation in the rock record, specifically by the amount of sedimentary rock representative of different time intervals that has been preserved at outcrop. To investigate how much of a problem this poses we have compiled a high-resolution record of marine rock outcrop area in Western Europe for the Phanerozoic and use this to generate a model that predicts the sampled diversity curve. We find that we can predict with high accuracy the variance of the marine genus diversity curve (itself dominated by European taxa) from rock outcrop data and a three-step model of diversity that tracks supercontinent fragmentation, coalescence and fragmentation. The size and position of two of the five major mass extinction spikes are largely predicted by rock outcrop data. We conclude that the long-term trends in taxonomic diversity and the end-Cretaceous extinction are not the result of rock area bias, but cannot rule out that rock outcrop area bias explains many of the short-term rises and falls in sampled diversity that palaeontologists have previously sought to explain biologically. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Palaeontological Association.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the planktonic foraminifera as tracers of past oceanic environments. Paleoceanography has always been closely connected with the study of planktonic foraminifera. The prolific production and excellent preservation of foraminiferal fossils in oceanic sediments has produced probably the best fossil record on Earth, providing unparalleled archives of morphological change, faunal variations, and habitat characteristics. Planktonic foraminifera are the most common source of paleoceanographic proxies, be it through the properties of their fossil assemblages or as a substrate for extraction of geochemical signals. The steady rain of foraminiferal shells is responsible for the deposition of a large portion of deep-sea biogenic carbonate. Stable isotopic signals extracted from planktonic foraminifera soon became a standard tool for the recognition of glacial cycles and eventually facilitated the recognition of orbital pacing of the ice-ages. The chemical composition of foraminiferal calcite proved to be a fertile ground for the development of proxies. The chapter highlights the most common and most promising foraminiferal proxies and puts them in the context of modern biological knowledge.},

abstract = {The Himalayas possess one of the largest resources of snow and ice, which act as a huge freshwater reservoir. Monitoring the glaciers is important to assess the overall reservoir health. In this investigation, glacial retreat was estimated for 466 glaciers in Chenab, Parbati and Baspa basins from 1962. Expeditions to Chhota Shigri, Patsio and Samudra Tapu glaciers in Chenab basin, Parbati glacier in Parbati basin and Shaune Garang glacier in Baspa basin were organized to identify and map the glacial terminus. The investigation has shown an overall reduction in glacier area from 2077 sq. km in 1962 to 1628 sq. km at present, an overall deglaciation of 21%. However, the number of glaciers has increased due to fragmentation. Mean area of glacial extent has reduced from 1.4 to 0.32 sq. km between the 1962 and 2001. In addition, the number of glaciers with higher areal extent has reduced and lower areal extent has increased during the period. Small glaciarates and ice fields have shown extensive deglaciation. For example, 127 glaciarates and ice fields less than 1 sq. km have shown retreat of 38% from 1962, possibly due to small response time. This indicates that a combination of glacial fragmentation, higher retreat of small glaciers and climate change are influencing the sustainability of Himalayan glaciers.},

It provides an integrated view of cli- mate change as the final part of the IPCCs Fourth Assessment Re- port (AR4). Topic 1 summarises observed changes in climate and their ef- fects on natural and human systems, regardless of their causes, while Topic 2 assesses the causes of the observed changes. Topic 3 pre- sents projections of future climate change and related impacts un- der different scenarios. Topic 4 discusses adaptation and mitigation options over the next few decades and their interactions with sustainable develop- ment. Topic 5 assesses the relationship between adaptation and mitigation on a more conceptual basis and takes a longer-term per- spective. Topic 6 summarises the major robust findings and remain- ing key uncertainties in this assessment. A schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers, impacts of and responses to climate change, and their linkages, is shown in Figure I.1. At the time of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the linkages clockwise, i.e. to derive climatic changes and impacts from socio-economic information and emissions. With increased under- standing of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkages also counterclockwise, i.e. to evaluate possible development path- ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.},

abstract = {In the European Alps the increase in air temperature was more than twice the increase in global mean temperature over the last 50 years. The abiotic (glacial) and the biotic components (plants and vegetation) of the mountain environment are showing ample evidence of climate change impacts. In the Alps most small glaciers (80% of total glacial coverage and an important contribution to water resources) could disappear in the next decades. Recently climate change was demonstrated to affect higher levels of ecological systems, with vegetation exhibiting surface area changes, indicating that alpine and nival vegetation may be able to respond in a fast and flexible way in response to 1-2°C warming. We analyzed the glacier evolution (terminus fluctuations, mass balances, surface area variations), local climate, and vegetation succession on the forefield of Sforzellina Glacier (Upper Valtellina, central Italian Alps) over the past three decades. We aimed to quantify the impacts of climate change on coupled biotic and abiotic components of high alpine ecosystems, to verify if an acceleration was occurring on them during the last decade (i.e., 1996-2006) and to assess whether new specific strategies were adopted for plant colonization and development. All the glaciological data indicate that a glacial retreat and shrinkage occurred and was much stronger after 2002 than during the last 35 years. Vegetation started to colonize surfaces deglaciated for only one year, with a rate at least four times greater than that reported in the literature for the establishment of scattered individuals and about two times greater for the well-established discontinuous early-successional community. The colonization strategy changed: the first colonizers are early-successional, scree slopes, and perennial clonal species with high phenotypic plasticity rather than pioneer and snowbed species. This impressive acceleration coincided with only slight local summer warming (approximately +0.5°C) and a poorly documented local decrease in the snow cover depth and duration. Are we facing accelerated ecological responses to climatic changes and/or did we go beyond a threshold over which major ecosystem changes may occur in response to even minor climatic variations? {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Then, it is correlated with climate data for the same period. In the late 1920s and in 1980, there was a maximum extent of the glaciers. The 1980 surge is due to high precipitations during the late 1970s, a similar trend being punctually observed in 1993. Between 1980 and 2003, the Rocher Blanc glaciers have strongly receded, their total surface being divided by ten. From 1997 onward, the large retreat can be explained by the increase of the mean daily temperature, especially the minimum daily temperature. Moreover, unusually high temperatures have been registered during the summer 2003 heat wave. Small mountain glaciers appear to be more sensitive to climate change than larger ones. Their surfaces change within 6 to 12 months. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using disc diffusion and E-test methods. Carbapenemase activity was detected using microbiological tests, including modified Hodge test, modified Carba NP test, and EDTA test. Carbapenem resistance determinants were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Clonal relatedness was determined using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST).\n\nRESULTS: A total of 67 A. baumannii isolates were obtained from 868 environmental samples and identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Among them, 61 isolates were resistant to imipenem with minimum inhibitory concentration >32$\mu$g/mL and positive by the modified Hodge test and modified Carba NP test. In addition, the activity of carbapenemase was inhibited by EDTA in 32 strains. PCR and sequencing showed the presence of blaOXA-23 gene in 29 strains, and the blaNDM-1 gene in 32 isolates. MLST demonstrated the presence of five types of ST (ST19, ST2, ST85, ST98, and ST115).\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the dissemination of carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii strains recovered from inanimate surfaces in a hospital environment, surrounding patients, healthcare workers and visitors, in Algeria as a potential source for nosocomial infection.},

abstract = {Over periods of tens of thousands to millions of years, periodic changes of climate due to astronomically defined variations in the distribution of solar energy over the Earth are of influence upon the climate and upon oceanic circulation systems. This in turn may affect the production of carbonate and organic matter in marine surface waters and the oxidation and dissolution of these products in the deep ocean. Rhythmic variations in the flux of the resulting pelagic sediments are readily preserved in the deep oceanic record. However, similar reflections of regular, astronomically induced fluctuations of climate have been widely observed in other sedimentary environments, including glacial, lacustrine, fluvial, aeolian, deltaic, shallow marine, and submarine fan. Periodic climatic and oceanographic changes and the resulting rhythmic sedimentation patterns can be preserved in the sedimentary record, providing that the sediment-supplying mechanisms (weathering and transport on the land, production of biogenic sediment in the ocean) as well as the relative sedimentary facies are sufficiently sensitive. Pelagic and lacustrine, and especially evaporitic, settings have proved to be sensitive to the influence of orbital forcing of climate. It is in such facies that, at the turn of the century, cyclicity in sedimentary sequences was recognized to be the result of orbital forcing (Gilbert, 1894; Bradley, 1929). Other sedimentary environments can be sensitive to such astronomically induced climatic variations in a similar way, but in many cases disturbing factors, such as variations in the rate of sedimentation and intermittent erosion, will obscure an otherwise clear record in the sedimentary column. Recognition of orbital cycles in environments other than the pelagic and lacustrine ones is of more recent date, but even coarse-grained alluvial fan and submarine fan environments can now be proven to bear the marks of orbitally induced climatic changes. Once demonstrated in the record, Milankovitch cycles have applications in assessing rates and durations of geological processes, and in the analysis of the palaeoclimate.},

abstract = {Estimates of peak global mean sea level (GMSL) during the Last Interglacial (LIG, ∼129-116 ka) based on geological sea level high-stand markers require a correction for the contaminating influence of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). This correction is obtained by calculating the viscoelastic response of the Earth to changes in the ice and ocean load prior to and following the LIG. While ice retreat over the last deglaciation is relatively well constrained, changes in ice cover prior to the LIG are more uncertain. We investigate the sensitivity of numerical predictions of GIA during the LIG to variations in the geometry of pre-LIG ice cover and the timing of the deglaciation into the LIG, with a particular focus on Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 (∼190-130 ka). We demonstrate that reconstructing the pre-LIG ice history by replicating the last glacial cycle back in time, rather than using ice volume approximations based on oxygen isotope records, can introduce errors in LIG high-stand predictions of ∼5 m at sites on the peripheral bulge of major ice complexes, and up to ∼2 m at far-field sites. We also demonstrate that predictions of LIG sea level are more sensitive to the geographic distribution of ice cover during MIS 6 than previously recognized. Adopting simulations which vary the relative size of Late Pleistocene ice cover over North America and Eurasia can yield a change in predicted high-stand elevations of ∼5 m in both the near and far field of northern hemisphere ice sheets. This far-field sensitivity arises, in part, from the reorientation of Earth's rotation axis during MIS 6, which in turn drives sea-level changes with a distinct geographic signature. In future work we will apply the insights gained here to re-evaluate the observed geographic variability in geological high-stand markers of LIG age and estimates of GMSL based upon them.},

The approximately 16-m-thick sampled part of the section can be subdivided, from bottom to top, into two biozones and a subbiozone: the Laufeldochitina stentor zone, the Eisenackitina rhenana subzone and the Lagenochitina dalbyensis zone. The boundary between the lowest biozone and the subzone is situated 1.7 m below the marker "F{\aa}gels{\aa}ng Phosphorite" bed, thus only slightly lower (0.3 m) than the base of the Nemagraptus gracilis graptolite biozone, which defines the base of the Upper Ordovician Series. The base of the L. dalbyensis zone is located just above the F{\aa}gels{\aa}ng Phosphorite, remarkably low compared to the graptolite biostratigraphy. It is evident that the chitinozoan biozonation provides an additional tool to recognise the base of the Upper Ordovician in this section. Furthermore, a distinct faunal change is shown across the phosphorite bed, possibly indicating a hiatus. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Recent developments in coherent ice core chronologies now enable us to depict with a precision of a few centuries the relationship between climate records in Greenland and Antarctica over the millennial scale variability of the Last Glacial period. Stacks of Greenland and Antarctic water isotopic records nicely illustrate a seesaw pattern with the abrupt warming in Greenland being concomitant with the beginning of the cooling in Antarctica at the Antarctic Isotopic Maximum (AIM). In addition, from the precise estimate of chronological error bars and additional high resolution measurements performed on the EDC and TALDICE ice cores, we show that the seesaw pattern does not explain the regional variability in Antarctic records with clear two step structures occurring during the warming phase of AIM 8 and 12. Our Antarctic high resolution data also suggest possible teleconnections between changes in low latitude atmospheric circulation and Antarctic without any Greenland temperature fingerprint.},

abstract = {The interaction between ice-sheet growth and retreat and sea-level change has been an established field of research for many years. However, recent advances in numerical modelling have shed new light on the precise interaction of marine ice sheets with the change in near-field sea level, and the related stability of the grounding line position. Studies using fully coupled ice-sheet – sea-level models have shown that accounting for gravitationally self-consistent sea-level change will act to slow down the retreat and advance of marine ice-sheet grounding lines. Moreover, by simultaneously solving the 'sea-level equation' and modelling ice-sheet flow, coupled models provide a global field of relative sea-level change that is consistent with dynamic changes in ice-sheet extent. In this paper we present an overview of recent advances, possible caveats, methodologies and challenges involved in coupled ice-sheet – sea-level modelling. We conclude by presenting a first-order comparison between a suite of relative sea-level data and output from a coupled ice-sheet – sea-level model.},

abstract = {Studies of sea level during previous interglacials provide insight into the stability of polar ice sheets in the face of global climate change. Commonly, these studies correct ancient sea-level highstands for the contaminating effect of isostatic adjustment associated with past ice age cycles, and interpret the residuals as being equivalent to the peak eustatic sea level associated with excess melting, relative to present day, of ancient polar ice sheets. However, the collapse of polar ice sheets produces a distinct geometry, or fingerprint, of sea-level change, which must be accounted for to accurately infer peak eustatic sea level from site-specific residual highstands. To explore this issue, we compute fingerprints associated with the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet, West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and marine sectors of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in order to isolate regions that would have been subject to greater-than-eustatic sea-level change for all three cases. These fingerprints are more robust than those associated with modern melting events, when applied to infer eustatic sea level, because: (1) a significant collapse of polar ice sheets reduces the sensitivity of the computed fingerprints to uncertainties in the geometry of the melt regions; and (2) the sea-level signal associated with the collapse will dominate the signal from steric effects. We evaluate these fingerprints at a suite of sites where sea-level records from interglacial marine isotopes stages (MIS) 5e and 11 have been obtained. Using these results, we demonstrate that previously discrepant estimates of peak eustatic sea level during MIS5e based on sea-level markers in Australia and the Seychelles are brought into closer accord. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Freshwater hosing has long been used in climate models to represent the perturbation associated with the release of icebergs during Heinrich Events. However, freshwater hosing ignores some of the icebergs-induced feedbacks on climate. It therefore bears the question whether the perturbed climate obtained through classical freshwater hosing experiments is realistic enough to be used as a proxy for a Heinrich Event. Using the fully coupled, water isotope enabled, climate model iLOVECLIM, we conducted a series of freshwater hosing experiments, accounting for the depleted signature of ice-sheet sourced water, under LGM conditions. Using paleoceanographic data, we integrated simulated and measured $\delta$18Ocalcite at the surface and within the ocean column to evaluate whether (i) LGM freshwater hosing is a good proxy for Heinrich Event 1 and whether (ii) different sources for the freshwater in the North Atlantic result in different spatial anomalies that could be used to fingerprint the source of melt water. Results obtained with two sets of experiments indicate that first order simulated $\delta$18Ocalcite anomalies are broadly consistent with the measured anomalies and that a complete shutdown of the thermohaline circulation is not consistent with the reconstructed patterns from foraminiferal calcite. A more detailed statistical analysis of the planktic and benthic $\delta$18Ocalcite anomalies shows that the best experiment is obtained for a severely disturbed thermohaline circulation but not a complete shutdown. With our model sensitivity, this corresponds to a freshwater flux between 0.18Sv and 0.3Sv. Our results also indicate a better agreement when the freshwater flux is applied in the Labrador Sea than when directly applied to the Ruddiman Belt.},

abstract = {On the basis of lake-level data, the period of the Preboreal oscillation (PBO) at 11 300-11 150 cal yr BP as defined by the GRIP oxygen-isotope record appears to correspond to wetter climatic conditions in west-central Europe and to a marked drying in north-central Italy. Additional short-lived phases of higher lake level have been identified before the PBO at ca 11 450-11 400 and 11 350 cal yr BP in west-central Europe, and at ca 11 500 cal yr BP in Italy. Such multiple climatic oscillations around the PBO have been observed in various records in northwestern Europe. On the basis of various proxies, a map of changes in moisture over western Europe during the PBO indicates a mid-latitude zone between 58 and 43°N characterised by wetter conditions, while a drier climate developed in southern and northern Europe. This wet middle zone shows a larger extension and suggests a more meandering, weaker Atlantic Westerly Jet during the PBO than during the 8.2 kyr event. A comparison of lake-level records in west-central Europe with (1) outbursts from North American and north-European proglacial lakes, and (2) variations in solar activity as reflected by 14 C and the 10 Be records supports the hypothesis that the PBO was a response to successive meltwater pulses at 11 300, 11 250, 11 200 and 11 170 cal yr BP and to a sudden decrease in solar activity at 11 250 cal yr BP. This study points to the necessity of developing integrated multi-proxy approaches to construct more robust regional event stratigraphies, and of better documenting palaeohydrological changes in the Mediterranean area. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is applied to a high-resolution lake sediment core retrieved from Southern Norway, resulting in a detailed record of Holocene river-flood activity covering the last 10,000 years, including floods also recorded by instrumental and historical data. The minimum number of individual floods recorded for this period is ∼100.On multidecadal to centennial timescales significant change in flood frequency is observed that arguably can be attributed to large-scale climatic changes such as the varying amount of winter precipitation and summer rainstorms. Flood frequency was low during the early Holocene (9770-7700 cal yr BP), and even lower for the period that followed, lasting until 5500 cal yr BP. For the next 2500 years, a modest increase in flood activity followed. This trend was truncated 2500 cal yr BP by a sudden shift towards increased flooding frequency. With the exception of a short interval around 1000 cal yr BP, when the number of floods again was low, this tendency of increased flood activity prevailed until present; including " Stor-Ofsen" , a large flood that occurred in AD 1789, and also three other historically documented river floods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {If model parameterizations of unresolved physics, such as the variety of upper ocean mixing processes, are to hold over the large range of time and space scales of importance to climate, they must be strongly physically based. Observations, theories, and models of oceanic vertical mixing are surveyed. Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffusion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic boundary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth h, where the turbulent contribution to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and nonlocal transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with similarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at h. This nonlocal “K profile parameterization” (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmospheric counterparts. Its most important feature is shown to be the capability of the boundary layer to penetrate well into a stable thermocline in both convective and wind‐driven situations. The diffusivities of the aforementioned three interior mixing processes are modeled as constants, functions of a gradient Richardson number (a measure of the relative importance of stratification to destabilizing shear), and functions of the double‐diffusion density ratio, R $\rho$ . Oceanic simulations of convective penetration, wind deepening, and diurnal cycling are used to determine appropriate values for various model parameters as weak functions of vertical resolution. Annual cycle simulations at ocean weather station Papa for 1961 and 1969–1974 are used to test the complete suite of parameterizations. Model and observed temperatures at all depths are shown to agree very well into September, after which systematic advective cooling in the ocean produces expected differences. It is argued that this cooling and a steady salt advection into the model are needed to balance the net annual surface heating and freshwater input. With these advections, good multiyear simulations of temperature and salinity can be achieved. These results and KPP simulations of the diurnal cycle at the Long‐Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) site are compared with the results of other models. It is demonstrated that the KPP model exchanges properties between the mixed layer and thermocline in a manner consistent with observations, and at least as well or better than alternatives.

It was discovered during a palynological study of a sedimentary succession of about 100 m, exposed along the Bolshaya Nirunda River, a right tributary of the Podkamennaya Tunguska River. The succession is located on the southern margin of the extensive epicontinental Tungus basin on the Siberian Platform between the Katanga and Yenisei land masses. The cryptospore assemblage was recovered from the siliciclastic-carbonate Dolbor Formation and scarcely from the overlying more carbonate Bur Formation. Both formations belong to the Katian Global Stage (Upper Ordovician). The cryptospores occur together with marine remnants (acritarchs, prasinophytes, chitinozoans, scolecodonts). It is similar to all known Upper Ordovician cryptospore assemblages in comprising naked and envelope-enclosed monads, dyads, tetrads and polyads. Although preservation is moderate to poor, the cryptospore taxa Velatitetras laevigata, Tetrahedraletes medinensis, Abditusdyadus laevigatus, Dyadospora murusdensa, Pseudodyadospora laevigata, Segestrespora laevigata and Sphaerasaccus glabellus can be identified.

abstract = {With few exceptions, the impact of the evolution of the terrestrial biosphere on the evolution of the marine sphere has been largely ignored. So too has the resulting complementary role of marine photosynthesis and primary productivity in the evolution of atmospheric and oceanic pCO2 and pO2 in response to land–sea interactions. The Early-Middle Palaeozoic invasion of the continents by plants is considered to be responsible for major changes in the carbon cycle and changing values of pO2 and pCO2 in the atmosphere. Some authors have also related the ‘terrestrialisation process' to the rapid Late Devonian decline of organic-walled phytoplankton (acritarch) diversity. The stratigraphical interval between the Carboniferous and early Triassic, i.e., the late Palaeozoic–Early Mesozoic, is a time period with a very low diversity of organic-walled phytoplankton, and this period was therefore considered by some authors as corresponding to a ‘Phytoplankton Blackout.' It has been argued that the marine food web during this interval was related to the invasion of land by plants, suggesting that a reduced nutrient input to the ocean by runoff decreased the number of acritarchs and primary production in the marine realm. Subsequently, it has also been suggested that the Phanerozoic phytoplankton record can be correlated with models of pCO2 with high acritarch diversities corresponding to periods of high pCO2. Conversely, the spread of terrestrial forests may have increased weathering rates via deeper rooting, releasing increased amounts of nutrients to the oceans while also increasing atmospheric pCO2. The present paper critically reviews the proposed scenarios and discusses the possible relations between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, in particular the possible impact of the terrestrialisation process on marine phytoplankton. The known Palaeozoic fossil record of the phytoplankton is incomplete to a high degree. It consists almost entirely on the organic-walled fraction, because calcareous and siliceous phytoplankton remain almost unrecorded. In addition, the fossil record solely provides information about the diversity of cysts, but not necessarily precise data of the number and quality of the cyst-producing phytoplanktonic organisms. Taking into consideration that only few modern phytoplankton taxa produce cysts, the absence of cysts in the fossil record does not necessarily imply the absence of phytoplankton. In contrast, the presence of planktotrophic larvae of marine invertebrate organisms indicates that phytoplankton must have been present in the Late Palaeozoic oceans, and the marine trophic web did indeed not collapse in the Late Devonian. The presence and abundance of filter feeding and suspension feeding benthic organisms such as brachiopods, crinoids, sponges and corals also suggest sufficient primary production in the Late Palaeozoic seas. It can be concluded that, although the phytoplankton is largely absent from the fossil record, a ‘phytoplankton blackout' is unrealistic. A major remaining question is to understand why the cyst production decreased after the Late Devonian and why this might be correlated to changes of pCO2.},

abstract = {Well preserved palynomorphs from the Hanadir Shale Member of the Qasim Formation (Darriwilian) from Saudi Arabia were recovered from wells KAHF-1 and TAYM-4, which include a variety of cryptospore tetrads, dyads and monads. An assemblage of these cryptospores is described systematically for the first time. Two new cryptospore genera, Cryptotetras and Didymospora are described; one new species of Rimosotetras, R. subsphaerica, is also erected to accommodate loosely arranged tetrads comprised of sub-spherical spore-members. The palynoflora appears to have more in common with younger assemblages of latest Ordovician and earliest Silurian age than it does with problematic spore-like microfossils from older strata, indicating that these cryptospores were produced by early embryophytes, true land plants. Given the somewhat advanced evolutionary spore character of the Hanadir assemblage, the gap between the megafossil record of plant axes and spores might indicate that the plants of the Ordovician were at a bryophyte grade of evolution. The possibility remains, however, that spore characters evolved in advance of other defining characters associated with the evolution of sporophytic plant phases on land.},

abstract = {A new model has been constructed for calculating the level of atmospheric CO2 during the past 570 million years. A series of successive steady states for CO2 is used in order to calculate CO2 level from a feedback function for the weathering of silicate minerals. Processes considered are: sedimentary burial of organic matter and carbonates; continental weathering of silicates, carbonates, and organic matter; and volcanic and metamorphic degassing of CO2. Sediment burial rates are calculated with the use of an isotope mass-balance model and carbon isotopic data on ancient seawater. Weathering rates are calculated from estimates of past changes in continental land area, mean elevation, and river runoff combined with estimates of the effects of the evolution of vascular land plants. Past degassing rates are estimated from changes in the rate of generation of sea floor and the shift of carbonate deposition from platforms to the deep sea. The model results indicate that CO2 levels were high during the Mesozoic and early Paleozoic and low during the Permo-Carboniferous and late Cenozoic. These results correspond to independently deduced Phanerozoic paleoclimates and support the notion that the atmospheric CO2 greenhouse mechanism is a major control on climate over very long time scales.},

This biostratigraphic restudy of its parastratotype in the Campo Section (northeastern Spain) based on planktic foraminifera, calcareous nannofossils, dinoflagellate cysts and the distribution of the stable isotopes ∂ 13 C and ∂ 18 O is an attempt to correlate the Paleocene/Eocene boundary based on a characteristic carbon isotope excursion (CIE) marking the onset of the Initial Eocene Thermal Maximum (IETM) and the Ilerdian stage. The base of this ∂ 13 C excursion has been chosen as the criterion for the recent proposal of the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) of the base of the Eocene (= base of the Ypresian) in the Dababiya Section (Egypt) to which an age of 54.9 Ma has been attributed. This level is also characterized by a marked extinction among the deep-water benthic foraminifera (Benthic Foraminifera Extinction Event, BFEE), a flood of representatives of the planktic foraminiferal genus Acarinina and the acme of dinoflagellate cysts of the genus Apectodinium. In the Campo Section, detailed biozonations (planktic foraminifera, calcareous nannofossils, dinoflagellate cysts) are recognized in the Lower and Middle Ilerdian. The correlation with the Ypresian stratotype is based on dinoflagellate cysts and calcareous nannofossils. The base of the Ilerdian is poor in planktic microfossils and its precise correlation with the redefined Paleocene/Eocene boundary remains uncertain. {\textcopyright} 2003 {\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS.

Accordingly, we disfavor an oxyl formulation for S 3.

Previous global bathymetric maps lacked features such as the 1600-kilometer-long Foundation Seamounts chain in the South Pacific. This map shows relations among the distributions of depth, sea floor area, and sea floor age that do not fit the predictions of deterministic models of subsidence due to lithosphere cooling but may be explained by a stochastic model in which randomly distributed reheating events warm the lithosphere and raise the ocean floor.},

It is represented by fossilized dispersed cryptospores and fragmentary plant remains. In the Early Silurian, cryptospore abundance and diversity diminished abruptly as trilete spores appeared, became abundant, and underwent rapid diversification. This change coincides approximately with the appearance of vascular plant megafossils and probably represents the origin and adaptive radiation of vascular plants. We have obtained a diverse trilete spore occurrence from the Late Ordovician that suggests that vascular plants originated and diversified earlier than previously hypothesized, in Gondwana, before migrating elsewhere and secondarily diversifying.},

This favorable climate regime implies not only that the oxygen isotopic composition of Ordovician seawater was similar to that of today, but also that climate played an overarching role in promoting the unprecedented increases in biodiversity that characterized this period.},

The analysis of a global diversity data set of ammonoid genera covering about 106 million years centered on the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) shows that Triassic ammonoids actually reached levels of diversity higher than in the Permian less than 2 million years after the PTB. The data favor a hierarchical rather than logistic model of diversification coupled with a niche incumbency hypothesis. This explosive and nondelayed diversification contrasts with the slow and delayed character of the Triassic biotic recovery as currently illustrated for other, mainly benthic groups such as bivalves and gastropods.},

New $\delta$18O data from the tropical Atlantic show synchronous shifts ∼91.2 million years ago for both the surface and deep ocean that are consistent with an approximately 200,000-year period of glaciation, with ice sheets of about half the size of the modern Antarctic ice cap. Even the prevailing supergreenhouse climate was not a barrier to the formation of large ice sheets, calling into question the common assumption that the poles were always ice-free during past periods of intense global warming.},

Evaluation of the timing and amplitude of individual sea-level events reveals that the magnitude of change is the most problematic to estimate accurately. The long-term sea level shows a gradual rise through the Cambrian, reaching a zenith in the Late Ordovician, then a short-lived but prominent withdrawal in response to Hirnantian glaciation. Subsequent but decreasingly substantial eustatic highs occurred in the mid-Silurian, near the Middle/Late Devonian boundary, and in the latest Carboniferous. Eustatic lows are recorded in the early Devonian, near the Mississippian/Pennsylvanian boundary, and in the Late Permian. One hundred and seventy-two eustatic events are documented for the Paleozoic, varying in magnitude from a few tens of meters to ∼125 meters.},

Under conditions expected in the 21st century, global warming and ocean acidification will compromise carbonate accretion, with corals becoming increasingly rare on reef systems. The result will be less diverse reef communities and carbonate reef structures that fail to be maintained. Climate change also exacerbates local stresses from declining water quality and overexploitation of key species, driving reefs increasingly toward the tipping point for functional collapse. This review presents future scenarios for coral reefs that predict increasingly serious consequences for reef-associated fisheries, tourism, coastal protection, and people.

The relatively weak seasonality of the stable subtropical and tropical oceans in the global model enabled long exclusion time scales and prolonged coexistence of multiple phytoplankton with comparable fitness. Superimposed on the decline in diversity seen from equator to pole were "hot spots" of enhanced diversity in some regions of energetic ocean circulation, which reflected lateral dispersal.},

These deposits are of economic significance as potential oil-bearing sandstones in the Tindouf and Boudenib basins and thus are here re-examined as analogues to subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs. Glaciogenic deposits of the Upper Second Bani Formation rest unconformably upon underlying shallow marine clastic deposits. The unconformity is characterised by a series of palaeovalleys, some 0.5-1.0 km wide, and up to 100 m deep, which may have been cut under elevated hydrostatic pressures as tunnel valleys beneath a Late Ordovician ice sheet. The valleys and intervalley areas are filled with glaciogene sediments categorized into five facies associations, namely 1) a tabular sandstone association (shallow marine/shoreface deposits), 2) a massive sandstone and conglomerate (ice contact debrites), 3) meandriform sandstone deposits (ice proximal sandur), 4) stratified diamictites (ice-rafted debris) and 5) sigmoidally bedded sandstones (intertidal sandstones). Deformation in these sediments is ubiquitous and includes soft-sediment striated pavements, metre-scale duplex systems, thrust and fold belts of deformation affecting some tens of metres of sediment, and pervasive lineations. These features are interpreted to record the complex nature of deformation processes operating beneath a Late Ordovician ice sheet including sliding at the ice-bed interface, folding and deformation within the sediment column, and a series of complex ramps, detachments and shear zones within an unconsolidated pile of sediment beneath the ice sheet. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically it discusses the evolution and the role of fluid pressure on the behaviour of subglacial sediments during deformation. During Little Ice Age maximum, the two outcrops studied, North J{\"{o}}kulsarlon (N-Jk) and Brennhola-Alda (BA), were located at 2550 m and 550 m respectively from the front of the Brei{eth}amerkurj{\"{o}}kull. Sedimentological analysis at the forefield of the glacier shows thick, coarse glaciofluvial deposits interbedded with thin, fine-grained shallow lacustrine/swamp deposits, overlain by a deformed till unit at N-Jk. BA outcrop shows fine-grained shallow lacustrine/swamp deposits overlain by a deformed till unit. The sequence of deformation events from one outcrop to the other is similar. First, major thrust planes, which were rooted in shallow lacustrine/swamp deposits developed by glacially induced simple shear. Next, the thrusts were folded, indicating the deformation of hydroplastic sediment assisted by moderate fluid pressure. Then clastic dyke swarms crosscut the sedimentary succession, proving that fluid overpressure caused hydrofracturing associated with fluidisation. Finally, as water escaped from the glacier bed, fluid pressure dropped, and normal faulting occurred in brittle-state subglacial sediments. Fluid-pressure variations are related to glacier dynamics. They control the deformation sequence by modifying subglacial rheological behaviour and the nature of the subglacial tectonism. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The postglacially raised sandy lobe is exposed in a 200-m-long river-section and exhibits six units that reflect an early phase of glaciomarine mud deposition followed by three episodes dominated by deposition from sandy turbidity currents. The lobe is characterized by a complex pattern of turbidite-filled erosional features, from thin scour-fills, reflecting a highly mobile flow pattern, to stacked chute-fill deposits showing confined flow. The sandy turbidites show 'rhythmic' deposition of massive to graded laminae deposited from suspension, alternating with faint laminae or ripple cross-lamination, deposited from fractional transport. Semi-continuous turbidity currents are thought to have been generated by retrogressive slumping of ice-proximal well-sorted sandy deposits on the delta front and slope. The lateral and vertical changes of lithofacies within the sandy lobe, are mainly attributed to normal mechanisms of turbiditic lobe growth, with only minor effect from synsedimentary glacier terminus movement and minor changes in the meltwater outflow position. This detailed mapping of facies changes allows a fairly accurate reconstruction of the axis of the former discharge outlet.},

abstract = {Late Ordovician siliciclastic glacial and related deposits on the North Gondwana continental shelf comprise striking incised features referred to as large-scale channel-fill structures. These are described from exposures and aerial photographs in two areas (Adrar and Hodh) in Mauritania. The channel-fill structures are up to several kilometres in length and several hundred metres wide. They are slightly sinuous narrow sandstone bodies deeply incised into the Late Orodovician glacial drift and the Cambro-Ordovician bedrock. Palaeogeographical reconstructions indicate that these structures were located in the ice-marginal zone. They are preferentially oriented parallel to palaeo-ice flow directions. Sedimentary faceis analysis reveals three vertically stacked architectural units infilling a U-shaped erosional basal unconformity. Unit 1 is thin and made up of conglomeratic sandstones of various origins comprising debris-flows, deltaic-like progradational foresets and trough cross-stratified sands. In Adrar, architectural unit 2 shows sheet-like, evenly laminated, fine- to medium-grained, well sorted sandstones characteristic of a high-energy marine environment. In contrast, in the Hodh area, unit 2 displays vertically stacked successions of coarse-grained sandstones that indicate high-discharge sediment-laden flows; these are interpreted as meltwater sediments. In both Adrar and Hodh, architectural unit 3 is made up of gravelly coarse-grained, trough cross-stratified sandstone emplaced in a braided, low sinuosity fluvial environment. The three-stage infilling history and the palaeogeographic location combined with size and shape criteria make it possible to compare the channel-fill structures with Pleistocene tunnel-valleys found in areas of low-relief in cool temperate and low Arctic zones. Such features are incised by high-pressure subglacial meltwater and later infilled by proglacial to postglacial deposits. Based on this comparison, architectural unit 1 represents subglacial or proglacial outwash, high sediment discharge in unit 2 took place in a proglacial environment in the Hodh area while an isostatically downwarped shelf was responsible for a marine incursion in the Adrar channels, and deposits in unit 3 are fluvial postglacial sediments. Identification of preserved channel-fill structures may be useful in reconstructing Late Ordovician ice-sheet dynamics.},

Here, we present transient simulations of coevolution of climate, ice sheets, and carbon cycle over the past 3 million years. We show that a gradual lowering of atmospheric CO2 and regolith removal are essential to reproduce the evolution of climate variability over the Quaternary. The long-term CO2 decrease leads to the initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation and an increase in the amplitude of glacial-interglacial variations, while the combined effect of CO2 decline and regolith removal controls the timing of the transition from a 41,000- to 100,000-year world. Our results suggest that the current CO2 concentration is unprecedented over the past 3 million years and that global temperature never exceeded the preindustrial value by more than 2°C during the Quaternary.},

abstract = {Mid-Ordovician limestones of southern Ontario are usually considered to be tropical shelf limestones and interpreted using facies models derived from Recent tropical carbonate environments. Nevertheless, depositional rates, grain types, faunas, erosion surfaces, mineralogy and geochemistry are more compatible with a temperate or even cold shelf environment. In view of the low latitudes (20°S) indicated by paleomagnetism, this suggests deposition in relatively cold seas, deposition below a tropical thermocline, or that the paleomagnetic data are wrong. Similar features in other Caradocian limestones of eastern North America show that these inferred cooler conditions were widespread. If deposition occurred below a tropical thermocline, most shallow-water Caradocian limestones must be re-interpreted as deeper-water deposits. More likely, in view of the evidence for temperate conditions in shallow water, is that the whole eastern seaboard of North America was affected by cold currents arising from southern polar ice caps, and thus was a temperate shelf environment. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {The oceans of the early Cambrian (∼541 to 509 million years ago) were the setting for a marked diversification of animal life. However, sea temperatures-a key component of the early Cambrian marine environment-remain unconstrained, in part because of a substantial time gap in the stable oxygen isotope (d18O) record before the evolution of euconodonts. We show that previously overlooked sources of fossil biogenic phosphate have the potential to fill this gap. Pristine phosphatic microfossils from the Comley Limestones, UK, yield a robust d18O signature, suggesting sea surface temperatures of 20° to 25°C at high southern paleolatitudes (∼65°S to 70°S) between ∼514 and 509 million years ago. These sea temperatures are consistent with the distribution of coeval evaporite and calcrete deposits, peak continental weathering rates, and also our climate model simulations for this interval. Our results support an early Cambrian greenhouse climate comparable to those of the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, offering a framework for exploring the interplay between biotic and environmental controls on Cambrian animal diversification.},

To explore the possible astronomical forcing preserved in this lithological record, continuous lithological rank and magnetic susceptibility (MS) stratigraphic series were obtained from a ˜ 34 m thick section of the Pingliang Formation at Guanzhuang. Power spectral analysis of the MS and rank series reveal 85.5 cm to 124 cm, 23 cm to 38 cm, and 15 cm to 27 cm thick sedimentary cycles that in ratio match that of late Ordovician short eccentricity, obliquity and precession astronomical cycles. The power spectrum of the MS time series, calibrated to interpreted short orbital eccentricity cycles, aligns with spectral peaks to astronomical parameters, including 95 kyr short orbital eccentricity, 35.3 kyr and 30.6 kyr obliquity, and 19.6 kyr and 16.3 kyr precession cycles. The 15 cm to 27 cm thick limestone–shale couplets mainly represent precession cycles, and siliceous bed deposition may be related to both precession and obliquity forcing. We propose that precession-forced sea-level fluctuations mainly controlled production of lime mud in a shallow marine environment, and transport to the basin. Precession and obliquity controlled biogenic silica productivity, and temperature-dependent preservation of silica may have been influenced by obliquity forcing.},

abstract = {Eccentricity cycles often exert a strong influence on sedimentary series, while they only have weak powers in the insolation series. Three case studies previously published in Early Cretaceous hemipelagic marl-limestone alternations of the Tethyan area are reviewed here to evaluate possible mechanisms of transfer of power from the precession to the eccentricity band. In all cases, the sedimentation rates vary cyclically, following the 405-kyr and the 2.4-myr eccentricity cycles. Maximums of sedimentation rates occur in more clayey intervals, suggesting a strong eccentricity forcing on detrital supply and consequently on sedimentation rates. In all sections, proxies related to purely detrital input show an overwhelming influence of the 405-kyr and the 2.4-myr eccentricity cycle compared to the other Milankovitch components. Proxies related to the carbonate production show lower amplitudes of the 405-kyr cycle and enhanced 100-kyr eccentricity cycle, which can dominate the power in the Milankovitch band. Memory effects of erosional and pedogenetic processes are proposed as powerful mechanisms of transfer of amplitude from the precession to the eccentricity band. Highly evolved pedogenesis under more humid climates have longer memory effects, which favor the 405-kyr and the 2.4-myr cycles in sedimentary series. Changes in phasing between carbonate production and insolation can suppress the low frequencies and favor the dominance of the 100-kyr eccentricity cycle. Consequently, in Tethyan Early Cretaceous deposits, clay-dominated marl-limestone alternations are associated to higher sedimentation rates and higher amplitudes of the long eccentricity cycles. Conversely, carbonate-dominated marl-limestone alternations are associated to lower sedimentation rates and higher amplitudes of the 100-kyr eccentricity cycles.},

abstract = {The Ediacaran–Cambrian interval was an eventful transitional period, when dynamic interactions between the biosphere and its physical environment allowed the Earth System to cross into a new state, characterized by the presence of metazoans, more equable climates and more expansive oxygenation of the oceans. Due to the retreat of widespread sulphidic conditions, redox-sensitive trace-metals could accumulate to a greater extent in ‘black shales' deposited in localized anoxic/euxinic environments, such as highly productive ocean margins. This study investigates the concentrations of the redox-sensitive trace-metals molybdenum and vanadium in organic-rich sedimentary rocks from seven sections of the Yangtze Platform, slope and basin. Iron speciation analyses were carried out in order to distinguish oxic, anoxic-ferruginous and anoxic-sulphidic settings, while sulphur and nitrogen isotope ratios were measured to gain insight into sulphate and nitrate availability, respectively, in the context of changing redox conditions. The data herein demonstrate an overall increase in redox-sensitive trace-metal contents in black shales across the Ediacaran–Cambrian transition, but with marked temporal and spatial variability. Euxinia is evident in South China before 551 Ma in the Ediacaran, and again in the early Cambrian. However, some time-equivalent sections are not enriched in redox-sensitive trace-metals, and also exhibit contrasting S-isotope and N-isotope systematics. A more complex configuration of the Yangtze Platform, for example with vast intrashelf basins, together with changing (generally rising) eustatic sea-level may account for this variability. In this regard, it is proposed that a mid-depth sulphidic wedge, caused by nutrient upwelling over the south-east platform margins, migrated over time (but generally landward), leading to spatially variable redox conditions determined by sea-level, currents and bathymetric constraints. The changing extents of anoxia and euxinia appear to have limited the distribution of emerging Ediacaran and Cambrian ecosystems.},

abstract = {Detailed outcrop studies at the flanks of Al Kufrah Basin, Libya, reveal the nature of glacially-related sedimentation and post-depositional deformation styles produced in association with the Late Ordovician glaciation, during which ice sheets expanded northward over North Africa to deposit the Mamuniyat Formation. At the SE basin flank (Jabal Azbah), the Mamuniyat Formation is sand-dominated, and incises interfingering braidplain and shallow marine deposits of the Hawaz Formation. The glacially-related sediments include intercalations of mud-chip bearing tabular sandstones and intraformational conglomerates, which are interpreted as turbidite and debrite facies respectively. These record aggradation of an extensive sediment wedge in front of a stable former ice margin. An increase in mudstone content northward is accompanied by the occurrence of more evolved turbidites. A widespread surface, bearing streamlined NW-SE striking ridges and grooves, punctuates this succession. The structures on the surface are interpreted to have formed during a regional north-westward ice advance. Above, siltstones bearing Arthrophycus burrows, and Orthocone-bearing sandstones beneath tidal bars testify to glaciomarine conditions for deposition of the underflow deposits beneath. By contrast, the northern basin margin (Jabal az-Zalmah) is appreciably different in recording shallower water/paralic sedimentation styles and major glaciotectonic deformation features, although facies analysis also reveals northward deepening. Here, a siltstone wedging from 8 to 50m toward the north was deposited (lower delta plain), succeeded by climbing ripple cross-laminated sandstones up to 60m in thickness (distal through proximal delta mouth bar deposits) with occasional diamictite interbeds. These rocks are deformed by thrusts and >50m amplitude fault-propagation folds, the deformation locally sealed by a diamictite then overlain by conglomeratic lag during ultimate deglaciation. Integrating observations from both basin margins, a model of fluvial-dominated delta systems feeding a pulsed debrite and turbidite fan system in a shallow proglacial shelf is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Glaciomarine deposits of late Hirnantian age in the western part of the Palaeozoic Balkan Terrane have persistent thickness ($\sim$ 7 m) and lateral uniformity in rock colour, bedding pattern, lithology, and sedimentary structures. Four lithofacies are distinguished from base to top: lonestone-bearing diamictites, interbedded structureless mudstones, crudely laminated diamictites, and finely laminated mudstones. The diamictites are clast-poor to clast-rich comprising muddy to sandy varieties. Their compositional maturity is evidenced by the very high amount of detrital quartz compared to the paucity of feldspar and unstable lithic grains. Other textural components include extraclasts derived from the local Ordovician basement, mudstone intraclasts, and sediment aggregates. Turbate structures, grain lineations, and soft sediment deformation of the matrix below larger grains are locally observed. Sedimentological analysis reveals that deposition occurred in an ice-intermediate to ice-distal, poorly agitated shelf environment by material supplied from meltwater buoyant plumes and rain-out from ice-rafted debris. Remobilization by mass-flow processes (cohesive debris flows and slumps) was an important mechanism particularly for the formation of massive diamictites. The glaciomarine deposits represent a typical deglaciation sequence reflecting retreat of the ice front (grounded or floating ice sheet), relative sea-level rise and gradually reduced sedimentation rate with increasing contribution from suspension fallout. This sequence was deposited on the non-glaciated shelf of the intracratonic North Gondwana platform along the southern margin of the Rheic Ocean. The Hirnantian strata of the Balkan Terrane can be correlated with similar glaciomarine deposits known from peri-Gondwana terranes elsewhere in Europe showing clear ‘Armorican affinity'. Several lines of evidence suggest that the provenance of siliciclastic material was associated mainly with sedimentary recycling of mature sands which had been deposited across North Gondwana in Cambrian and pre-glacial Ordovician times.},

abstract = {In biogeography, the similarity distance decay (SDD) relationship refers to the decrease in compositional similarity between communities with geographical distance. Although representing one of the most widely used relationships in biogeography, a review of the literature reveals that: (1) SDD is influenced by both spatial extent and sample size; (2) the potential effect of the phylogenetic level has yet to be tested; (3) the effect of a marked biogeographical structuring upon SDD patterns is largely unknown; and (4) the SDD relationship is usually explored with modern, mainly terrestrial organisms, whereas fossil taxa are seldom used in that perspective. Using this relationship, we explore the long-distance dispersal of the Early Jurassic (early Pliensbachian, c. 190.8 Ma to 187.6 Ma) ammonites of the western Tethys and adjacent areas, in a context of marked provincialism. We show that the long-distance dispersal of these ammonites is not related to shell size and shape, but rather to the environmental characteristics of the province to which they belong. This suggests that their long-distance dispersal may have been essentially driven by passive planktonic drift during early juvenile, post-hatching stages. Furthermore, it seems that the SDD relationship is not always an appropriate method to characterize the existence of a biogeographical structuring. We conducted SDD analyses at various spatial, sampling and phylogenetic scales in order to evaluate their sensitivity to scale effects. This multi-scale approach indicates that the sampling scale may influence SDD rates in an unpredictable way and that the phylogenetic level has a major impact on SDD patterns.},

abstract = {Phosphorus is a nutrient fundamental to life and when it precipitates in modern environments bacteria are intimately involved in its release, concentration, and mineralization. Preserved fossil bacteria in phosphate crusts and grains from the ca. 1850 million-year-old Bijiki Iron Formation Member of the Michigamme Formation, Michigan provide insight into the longevity and nature of this relationship. The Michigamme Formation accumulated near the end of the Earth's initial phosphogenic episode (ca. 2.2 and 1.8. Ga) to produce one of the first granular phosphorites. Phosphatic lithofacies consist of fine- to medium-sand-sized francolite peloids concentrated on bedding surfaces in peritidal facies. Granular beds are up to 2. cm thick and peloids are often partially to completely replaced by dolomite and chert. The grains contain organic matter and pyrite framboids that suggest bacterial breakdown of organic matter and bacterial sulfate reduction. The peritidal nature of phosphorite in the Michigamme Formation is in sharp contrast to Phanerozoic phosphogenic environments in deeper coastal upwelling settings. Peritidal settings were well suited for phosphogenesis under the very low oxygen and low dissolved sulfate levels of the Paleoproterozoic as cyanobacteria produced oxygen in shallow water and evaporation led to increased sulfate concentrations. Such concomitant processes helped establish focused redox interfaces in the sediment that chemosynthetic bacterial communities (sulfur oxidizers, reducers, forms that concentrate P, and possibly iron oxidizers) could exploit. Phosphate released from organic matter by heterotrophic bacteria and Fe-redox pumping was further concentrated by these chemotrophs; a process that forms late Neoproterozoic to Phanerozoic phosphorites but on a much larger scale. This early example of a granular phosphorite demonstrates that, like their Phanerozoic counterparts, Paleoproterozoic phosphorites are the concentrated indirectly biomineralized products of bacterial communities. But unlike younger analogs, which accumulated across subtidal shelves and shelf margins, these ancient deposits formed only in tidal flat settings where phosphogenic redox processes could be established in the sediment. From this early beginning, the zone of phosphogenesis likely migrated into deeper water settings as oxygen and sulfate levels rose, expanding the zone of chemosynthetic bacterial and associated phosphogenesis across the shelf.},

The first diversity acme (Tremadocian-Floian) was strongly diachronous across both the paleoblocks and groups of organisms. But within a 10. myr interval, during mainly the Middle Ordovician (Darriwilian), the global marine species richness was tripled, i.e., the second diversity acme. The third acme (Katian) was much more unified across both taxonomic groups and terranes. This diversification trend continued into the Silurian and Devonian making GOBE the most sustained marine biodiversity pulse of the entire Phanerozoic. The GOBE was also marked by three major faunal turnovers based on the brachiopod data, in the mid-Darriwilian, end-Katian, and end-Hirnantian, respectively. Each turnover was followed by an explosive radiation of new faunas, especially in the shallow-marine shelly benthos. Potential intrinsic or extrinsic drivers for this event are widely debated, but a causal narrative remains elusive.},

abstract = {The Ordovician and Silurian periods were times of major geological activity as regards palaeogeography, volcanism and climate change, the last of these evidenced by a series of cooling episodes and glaciations that climaxed in the Hirnantian (Late Ordovician). The presence of cryptospores in the Darriwilian (Middle Ordovician) marked the advent of higher plants on land. A critical survey of direct (mega- and microfossils) and some indirect evidence in succeeding rocks indicates the presence of algae, Bacteria, Cyanobacteria, Fungi, probable lichens, cryptophytes and basal tracheophytes. Similar associations of photosynthesizers and decomposers occur today in cryptogamic covers (CCs), for example biological crusts, except that bryophytes replace cryptophytes (basal embryophytes) and tracheophytes are absent. Thus, extant CCs, which make significant contributions today to global carbon and nitrogen fixation and prevention of erosion, provide an excellent analogue for the impacts of early land vegetation on both lithosphere and atmosphere. As a prerequisite to assessing impacts in Ordovician-Silurian times, with particular consideration of parameters used by climate modellers, the effects of a number of abiotic factors on the growth and survival of extant cryptogamic ground covers and their environmental impacts are reviewed. Factors include photosynthetically active radiation, ultraviolet radiation, temperature, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, surface roughness and albedo. A survey of the nature and extent of weathering facilitated by such vegetation concludes that it was limited based on depth of weathering when compared with that from rooted tracheophytes today, with minor effects on carbon dioxide drawdown. As global net productivity from Ordovician-Silurian CCs was very probably lower than today, and while the small fraction of intractable material in their organic carbon would have resulted in a more rapid turnover of terrestrial biomass, we conclude that there was decreased possibility of long-term organic carbon burial. Hence, there would have been very limited increase in atmospheric oxygen and decrease in carbon dioxide resulting from carbon burial.},

abstract = {It is often assumed that life originated and diversified in the oceans prior to colonizing the land. However, environmental constraints in chemical evolution models point towards critical steps leading to the origin of life as having occurred in subaerial settings. The earliest fossil record does not include finds from terrestrial deposits, so much of our understanding about the presence of a terrestrial microbial cover prior to the Proterozoic is based on inference and geochemical proxies that indicate biospheric carbon cycling during the Archaean. Our assessment is that by 2.7Ga, microbial ecosystems in terrestrial settings were driven by oxygen-generating, photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Studies of modern organisms indicate that both the origin and primary diversification of the eukaryotes could have occurred in terrestrial settings, shortly after 2.0Ga, but there is no direct fossil evidence of terrestrial eukaryotes until about 1.1Ga. At this time, it appears that the diversity of life in non-marine habitats exceeded that found in marine settings where sulphidic seas may have impaired eukaryotic physiology and retarded evolution. Geochemical proxies indicate the establishment of an extensive soil-forming microbial cover by 850Ma, and it is possible that a rise in atmospheric oxygen at this time was due to the evolutionary expansion of green algae into terrestrial habitats. Direct fossil evidence of the earliest terrestrial biotas in the Phanerozoic consists of problematical palynomorphs from the Cambro-Ordovician of Laurentia. These indicate that the evolution of the first land plants (embryophytes) during the Middle Ordovician took place within a landscape that included aeroterrestrial algae which were actively adapting to selection in subaerial settings.},

abstract = {In the Canadian part of Laurentia, large systematic conodont collections were assembled by many specialists over recent decades primarily for lower Paleozoic biostratigraphy, with some having sampling strategies to test ecologic hypotheses. The Laurentian plate straddled the paleoequator and accumulated extensive carbonate deposits, amenable to conodont recovery. In particular, the glaciated and mountainous Canadian part of Laurentia has permitted extensive collections through well-exposed shelf-to-basin transects across continental margins of the Appalachian, Cordilleran and Innuitian (Arctic) orogens, as well as intracratonic sedimentary basins and foreland basins affected by tectonism. From these remarkable settings, integrated studies by specialists of biostratigraphy, evolution, paleoecology, and paleobiogeography, together with oxygen, strontium and neodymium isotope analyses of conodont hard tissues, have involved nearly 700,000 conodonts from over 8000 samples from relatively undeformed stratigraphic sections. The results, with stratigraphic and sedimentologic data, have enabled interpretations of early Paleozoic climatic, oceanographic and eustatic changes and effects of tectonism. The late Cambrian-Early Ordovician exhibits the origin of euconodonts and initial diversification of coniform and ramiform apparatuses. By Middle Ordovician more complex apparatuses evolved with pectiniform (P) elements, with more complex community organization. Responses to sea-level changes can be tracked on both sides of the paleoequator from Cordilleran and Appalachian collections. Middle-Late Ordovician experienced extensive transgressive events, wider carbonate platforms, and the paleogeographic influence of residual Precambrian basement highs that partitioned conodonts into subprovinces. Restricted circulation and hypersalinity in these epeiric seas fostered specialized inshore communities with neurodonts and rhipidognathids. Terminal Ordovician mass extinction event (Gondwanan glaciation) affected forms with elaborate apparatuses whereas many coniform species survived. Slow radiation within the early Rhuddanian (early Silurian) produced community restructuring followed by progressive diversity increase punctuated by minor extinctions, some related to Gondwanan glacial re-advances. Oxygen isotopes show brief paleotemperature perturbations correlated to named episodes and events. Post-Rhuddanian conodont communities were well-defined, laterally segregated, with weak provincialism, and affected by oceanographic events and cratonic amalgamation with closure of the Iapetus Ocean and docking of Baltica, Avalonia and Pearya against Laurentia.},

abstract = {The Yangtze Sea of the South China Craton experienced strong environmental perturbations during the first $\sim$ 5-6 Myr of the Silurian. The Lower Silurian Lungmachi Formation in the Jiaoye-1 drillcore (Chongqing, China) records three sea-level cycles (stratigraphic sequences) characterized by rapid deepening at the base of each cycle followed by slow shallowing. Each deepening event was associated with shifts toward higher marine productivity, more intensely reducing bottomwater conditions, reduced watermass restriction, lower detrital input, and enhanced siliciclastic weathering intensity. We infer control by glacio-eustasy, in which deglacial sea-level rises and concurrent climatic warming triggered the observed environmental changes. Shallowing was associated with renewed glaciation and characterized by the opposite set of conditions. The results of this study thus provide evidence in support of continued continental glaciation during the Early Silurian, i.e., following the termination of the major end-Ordovician Hirnantian glaciation. The study core also exhibits a long-term shallowing trend through the entire Lower Silurian, the origin of which may have been tectono-epeirogenic uplift of the South China Craton during the Kwangsian Orogeny.},

abstract = {In order to assess how the last sea level rise affected the Aegean archipelago, we quantified the magnitude and rate of geographic change for the Aegean islands during the last sea-level-rise episode (21 kyr BP–present) with a spatially explicit geophysical model. An island-specific Area-Distance-Change (ADC) typology was constructed, with higher ADC values representing a higher degree of change. The highest fragmentation rates of the Aegean archipelago occurred in tandem with the largest rates of sea-level-rise occurring between 17 kyr and 7 kyr ago. Sea-level rise resulted in an area loss for the Aegean archipelago of approximately 70%. Spatiotemporal differences in sea-level changes across the Aegean Sea and irregular bathymetry produced a variety of island surface-area loss responses, with area losses ranging from 20% to > 90% per island. In addition, sea-level rise led to increased island isolation, increasing distances of islands to continents to > 200% for some islands. We discuss how rates of area contractions and distance increases may have affected biotas, their evolutionary history and genetics. Five testable hypotheses are proposed to guide future research. We hypothesize that islands with higher ADC-values will exhibit higher degrees of community hyper-saturation, more local extinctions, larger genetic bottlenecks, higher genetic diversity within species pools, more endemics and shared species on continental fragments and higher z-values of the power-law species-area relationship. The developed typology and the quantified geographic response to sea-level rise of continental islands, as in the Aegean Sea, present an ideal research framework to test biogeographic and evolutionary hypotheses assessing the role of rates of area and distance change affecting biota.},

abstract = {Organic-rich Upper Cretaceous sequences in Israel were deposited in an extensive, highly productive upwelling-linked system which prevailed along the southern Tethys margin, and lasted for approximately 19 m.y. (Santonian to late Maastrichtian). An understanding of the spatial and temporal characteristics of this system was gained through detailed paleontological and geochemical analyses of subsurface sequences in two basins in Israel, representing an outer (Shefela) and an inner (Zin) facies belt. The nature of the upwelling system, and its effect on the sedimentary record, is related to two basic environmental parameters, namely paleoproductivity intensity and oxygen levels at the bottom. The assessment of these parameters and their interrelationship has been performed through the development of paleontological (foraminiferal) criteria, which are independent of the organic matter content. Following the establishment of these criteria, it is concluded that the productivity reached its maximum intensity during the late Campanian, which was also the time of most notable differentiation between the center of the upwelling system in the inner belt and the less intense conditions in the outer basin. This distribution is expressed in varied lithology (organic-rich carbonates, phosphorites, and siliceous rocks) at the core of upwelling and a uniform lithology (organic-rich carbonates) at the margin of this system. The uniform lithology of the Maastrichtian in both basins, composed of organic-rich carbonates, is ascribed to a gradual weakening of productivity. The bottom conditions in the inner belt during the late Campanian (the time of maximum surface productivity) were near anoxic, changing to more aerated (dysaerobic) conditions during the early Maastrichtian. In the outer belt a more aerated bottom (dysaerobic) prevailed throughout the late Campanian to late Maastrichtian. The elevated organic matter content in both basins reflects the overall environment of high productivity; its actual variations, however, seem to be unrelated to changes in surface productivity and bottom oxygen levels.},

abstract = {Sites of calcium‐magnesium carbonate accumulation have been shifting from shallow shelf to deep marine settings since the late Cretaceous. During this time, total area of flooded epicratonic shelf has decreased about 50%, and areas of shelf carbonate deposition have declined from 27 × 106 km² to present areas of 1.4 × 106 km² while the maximum extent of platform carbonate accumulation has decreased from about 50° to 28° north latitude. In terms of cratonic carbonate, this decrease in tropical shelf area has resulted in a sixfold reduction in shoal‐water limestone accumulation from a Cretaceous rate of 0.6 × km³/m.y. to a present value of about 0.1 × 106 km³/m.y.. Over the same time period, the global carbonate compensation depth has deepened by about 1.5 km, attendant with a threefold areal increase of calcite ooze depositionn (40 to 130 × 106 km²). This expansion has resulted in an eightfold increase in pelagic limestone accumulation from a Cretaceous rate of 0.05 × 106 km³/m.y. to a present rate of about 0.4 × 106 km³/m.y. Transfer of accumulation from shallow cratonic to deep marine depositional settings records the central role of sedimentary environment surface area in predicating the differential partitioning of finite carbonate fluxes to Phanerozoic global oceans.

abstract = {A standard explanation for coupling climate variations in the northern and southern hemispheres involves fluctuations in North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) production. However, I suggest that the “NADW‐Antarctic” connection may work opposite to that conjectured by many investigators; that is, when NADW production rates are high, southern hemisphere temperatures decrease rather than increase. The revised interpretation is consistent with observations and ocean modeling studies which demonstrate that, although upwelling of relatively warm NADW water around Antarctica promotes sea ice meltback, a second and more important negative feedback is also operating. In order to conserve volume, southward export of NADW across the equator is accompanied by import of an equivalent volume of considerably warmer water from shallower oceanic layers in the South Atlantic. The southern hemisphere loses heat as a result of this exchange. The hemispherically averaged net heat loss may be as high as 4 W/m², an amount comparable to a CO2 doubling. It is suggested that this more comprehensive view of the role of NADW may explain both decadal‐scale variations in South Atlantic sea surface temperatures in this century and two significant problems in Pleistocene climatology: why southern hemisphere temperatures decreased before CO2 levels decreased at the end of the last interglacial and why southern hemisphere temperature changes precede changes in northern hemisphere ice volume. It is shown that when NADW production was reinitiated during the last interglacial (120,000 B.P.), high‐latitude southern hemisphere temperatures decreased. The estimated magnitude of altered southern hemisphere heat export is comparable to the ice‐age CO2 signal and may be able to account for the observed cooling even when CO2 levels were high. When cast into a frequency domain framework, this interpretation may also help explain why southern hemisphere temperatures lead global ice volume changes.

abstract = {The North American craton is 25% covered by Lower Silurian (Llandovery) rocks based strictly upon the geographic area of surviving marine strata preserved in outcrop and the subsurface. This figure does not take into account extensive post‐Silurian tectonics and erosion. Isolated structural basins in which these strata are found today were not necessarily defined as corresponding topographic basins in the Silurian. Analysis of interbasin structural arches and outliers provides important clues as to the actual extent of Early Silurian seas. Information on the age of tectonic origin for 15 prominent arches is reviewed. The placement and significance of 11 key outliers is also discussed. Evidence of this kind indicates Early Silurian platform seas were among the most extensive of the Paleozoic. Probably more than 65% of the North American craton was then flooded. Nothing on so vast a scale serves as a recent guide to the past. The Pliocene‐Holocene Bahamian Banks do provide, however, worthy models for the role of bathymetry and water circulation as related to the changeover from laterally monotonous blanket deposits to a more complex mosaic of facies. The original bathymetry of Early Silurian environments may be determined, correlated, and mapped on the basis of widespread carbonate cycles linked to sea level fluctuations. The range of fully integrated facies patterns includes (1) coral‐stromatoporoid/stromatolite/paleosol cycles (Williston Basin), (2) pentamerid brachiopod/coral‐stromatoporoid/stromatolite cycles (Michigan Basin), and (3) stricklandiid brachiopod/pentamerid brachiopod/coral‐stromatoporoid cycles (East Iowa Basin). With shallow bathymetries of 0–30 m the Williston class tends to represent mosaic facies, while with bathymetries of 0–60 m and 10–90 m the deeper‐water Michigan and Iowa classes typically involve blanket deposits. Bathymetry of other basin deposits generally fits one of these three classes. Maximum and minimum stands in sea level during Late Llandovery time are represented by bathymetric maps.

abstract = {The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) represents a four-fold increase of genus-level diversity that post-dates the diversification of the ‘Cambrian explosion' by 40–50 Myr. A major increase in atmospheric oxygen (O 2 ) levels is thought to be a leading cause of the ‘Cambrian explosion' that lowered metabolic costs associated with skeletal and collagen biomineralization. The cause(s) of the GOBE, however, is (are) less well understood, and may include a cooling climate, increased nutrient availability, higher sea levels and increased ecospace, and further oxygenation of shallow marine environments. Atmospheric O 2 levels are difficult to quantitatively estimate, particularly whether oxygenation was a plausible driver of the GOBE, because O 2 estimates are hampered in part by the coarse time resolution of redox proxy records (e.g., iron-based geochemical data) and isotope mass balance models. Newly published high-resolution geochemical trends are used to better constrain the timing and degree of oxygenation across the GOBE, which include traditional methods such as stable carbon ($\delta$ 13 C) and sulfur ($\delta$ 34 S) isotope trends to estimate O 2 levels on a global scale, and local-scale redox-sensitive proxies such as iodine (I/Ca) and trace metal concentrations and isotopes (e.g., Mo and U). Taken together, geochemical evidence suggests that Ordovician environments became progressively more oxygenated following the end of recurrent anoxic events and extinctions of late Cambrian and Early Ordovician marine faunas. A sluggishly circulating Cambrian global ocean could have maintained an oxycline in the water column that impinged upon the continental shelf, which extended into wide expanses of shallow shelf settings during relative sea level rises that caused positive $\delta$ 13 C and $\delta$ 34 S excursions and mass extinctions. Ordovician oxygenation roughly corresponds to cessation of positive $\delta$ 13 C excursions (i.e., shallow water anoxia) and the major pulses of biodiversification that comprise the GOBE, suggesting that oxygenation was an important driver of Ordovician biodiversity. Anoxic conditions below an oxycline that impinged upon the continental shelf likely persisted until the Devonian when a cooler climate invigorated circulation and ventilated the global ocean, with the possible exception of some isolated basins that were persistently anoxic.},

abstract = {The evolution of the Early Cretaceous, northern Tethyan carbonate platform was not only influenced by changes in sea level, detrital influx, and surface water temperature but also by changes in trophic levels. We distinguish between phases of carbonate production dominated by oligotrophic photozoan communities and by mesotrophic and eventually colder-water heterozoan communities. Superimposed on this bimodal trend in platform evolution were phases of platform demise for which we provide improved age control based on ammonite biostratigraphy. The initial phase of these episodes of platform demise corresponds in time to episodes of oceanic anoxic events and environmental change in general. On the basis of a comparison between the temporal changes in an Early Cretaceous, ammonite-calibrated $\delta$13C record from southeastern France and coeval changes in the platform record, we suggest that the history of carbon fractionation along the northern Tethyan margin was not only influenced by changes in the oceanic carbon cycle such as in the rate of production and preservation of organic and carbonate carbon and in the size of the oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon reservoir, but it was also influenced by the above-mentioned changes in the ecology and geometry of the adjacent carbonate platform. Phases of photozoan carbonate production induced positive trends in the hemipelagic carbonate $\delta$13C record. Phases of heterozoan carbonate production pushed the $\delta$13C system toward more negative values. Platform drowning episodes implied an initial increase in $\delta$13C values, followed by a longer-term decrease in $\delta$13C values. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Using a fully coupled climate model in an idealized setup, we compare situations corresponding to the late Oligocene, the early Miocene, and present day. The model results show the existence of a flow reversal through the Panama Seaway between the Oligocene and Miocene. This flow reversal is induced by global tectonic changes related to the widening of the Southern Ocean passages and the closing of the Tethys Seaway. It mainly involves the wind-driven ocean circulation, in agreement with previous model studies. The global thermohaline circulation in the Oligocene and Miocene simulations is significantly different from the present-day conveyor circulation, as there is deepwater formation in both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific oceans. In particular, in the Oligocene simulation the salinity contrast between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans is reduced because of water mass exchange through the low-latitude connections between the two oceans.

abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) estimates for the Middle Cretaceous (MK) have a range of >4000 ppm, which presents considerable uncertainty in understanding the possible causes of warmth for this interval. This paper examines the problem of MK greenhouse forcing from an inverse perspective: we estimate upper ocean water temperatures from oxygen isotope measurements of well-preserved late Albian–Turonian planktonic foraminifera and compare these against temperatures predicted by general circulation model (GCM) experiments with CO2 concentrations of 500–7500 ppm. At least 4500 ppm CO2 is required to match maximum temperatures inferred from well-preserved planktonic foraminifera. Approximately 900 ppm CO2 produces a good match between the model and the minimum temperature estimates for the MK. An ocean model forced by these two extremes in surface conditions brackets nearly all available bottom water temperature estimates for this interval. The climate model results support nearly the entire range of MK CO2 estimates from proxy data. The ocean model suggests possible MK oceanographic changes from deep water formation in the high latitude region of one hemisphere to the other hemisphere in response to changes in atmospheric temperatures and hydrologic cycle strength. We suggest that, rather than contradicting one another, the various proxy CO2 techniques (especially those with high temporal resolution) may capture true variability in CO2 concentrations and that MK CO2 could have varied by several thousand ppm through this interval.},

abstract = {We examine the relationships between ocean ventilation, primary production, water column anoxia, and benthic regeneration of phosphorus using a mass balance model of the coupled marine biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and phosphorus (P). The elemental cycles are coupled via the Redfield C/P ratio of marine phytoplankton and the C/P ratio of organic matter preserved in marine sediments. The model assumes that on geologic timescales, net primary production in the oceans is limited by the upwelling of dissolved phosphorus to the photic zone. The model incorporates the dependence on bottom water oxygenation of the regeneration of nutrient phosphorus from particulate matter deposited at the water‐sediment interface. Evidence from marine and lacustrine settings, modern and ancient, demonstrates that sedimentary burial of phosphorus associated with organic matter and ferric oxyhydroxides decreases when bottom water anoxia‐dysoxia expands. Steady state simulations show that a reduction in the rate of thermohaline circulation, or a decrease of the oxygen content of downwelling water masses, intensifies water column anoxia‐dysoxia and at the same time increases surface water productivity. The first effect reflects the declining supply of oxygen to the deeper parts of the ocean. The second effect is caused by the enhanced benthic regeneration of phosphorus from organic matter and ferric oxyhydroxides. Sedimentary burial of organic carbon and authigenic calcium phosphate mineral (francolite), on the other hand, is promoted by reduced ocean ventilation. According to the model, global‐scale anoxia‐dysoxia leads to a more efficient recycling of reactive phosphorus within the ocean system. Consequently, higher rates of primary production and organic carbon burial can be achieved, even when the continental supply of reactive phosphorus to the oceans remains unchanged.

The event is related to a period of global warming and characterized by major perturbations to the hydrological and carbon cycles with high rates of organic matter burial in shelf seas. Ocean circulation during the Toarcian and its influence on marine biogeochemical cycles are still not fully understood. Here we assess the spatial extent of anoxia in the NW Tethys Ocean during the T-OAE, the relationship with ocean circulation and the impact on organic carbon burial, using new and existing sedimentary records from the European Epicontinental Shelf in combination with general circulation model results. We demonstrate that bottom waters on the southwestern part of the shelf were mainly oxic during the T-OAE, while those in the northeastern basins were mostly anoxic or even sulfidic. Results for two ocean-atmosphere models (Fast Ocean-Atmosphere Model and Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model) suggest the presence of a strong clockwise gyre over the European Epicontinental Shelf, which brought oxygenated equatorial waters from the Tethys Ocean to the southern shelf. The northward limb of the gyre was significantly weakened due to the rough bathymetry of the northern shelf, making this relative small region highly sensitive to local ocean stratification. These sluggish ocean dynamics promoted bottom water anoxia and enhanced burial of organic carbon in the northeastern basins, which accounted for 3–5% of the total carbon extracted from the ocean-atmosphere system as recorded by the positive carbon isotope shift.},

abstract = {The fossil record reveals large changes in marine plankton ecosystems linked with both environmental and ecological change across the Cenozoic. An understanding of the drivers of these changes is key to understanding the marine carbon cycle. The response of plankton ecosystems in past warm climates also provides a key analogue for current climate change. While models are employed to quantify interactions between the environment and the biota, current Earth system models strongly encode our understanding of modern marine ecosystems. By contrast, trait-based models aim to describe the marine plankton ecosystem in terms of fundamental ecological and physiological rules that are less likely to change through time. This provides a unique opportunity to assess the interactions between marine ecosystem and paleoclimate. For the first time, we apply a size-structured trait-based plankton ecosystem model embedded in the Earth system model of intermediate complexity, cGENIE, to model plankton communities for the warm climate of the early Eocene. Compared to modern, we find the warm climate is associated with an increase in the mean cell size of plankton communities and export production, particularly in the southern high latitudes, along with lower total phytoplankton biomass. Paleogeography has an important role in regulating the effect of ecosystem structure via changes in ocean circulation and nutrient cycling. Warmer temperatures also drive changes due to enhanced zooplankton grazing. An integration of the fossil record with plankton ecosystem models will provide a powerful tool to assess the impacts of warm climates on marine systems.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of different CO2 levels and different subarctic gateway configurations on the surface temperatures during the latest Cretaceous using the Earth System Model COSMOS. The simulated temperatures are compared with the surface temperature reconstructions based on a recent compilation of the latest Cretaceous proxies. In our numerical experiments, the CO2 level ranges from 1 to 6 times the preindustrial (PI) CO2 level of 280 ppm. On a global scale, the most reasonable match between modeling and proxy data is obtained for the experiments with 3 to 5 × PI CO2 concentrations. However, the simulated low- (high-) latitude temperatures are too high (low) as compared to the proxy data. The moderate CO2 levels scenarios might be more realistic, if we take into account proxy data and the dead zone effect criterion. Furthermore, we test if the model-data discrepancies can be caused by too simplistic proxy-data interpretations. This is distinctly seen at high latitudes, where most proxies are biased toward summer temperatures. Additional sensitivity experiments with different ocean gateway configurations and constant CO2 level indicate only minor surface temperatures changes (<$\sim$1°C) on a global scale, with higher values (up to $\sim$8°C) on a regional scale. These findings imply that modeled and reconstructed temperature gradients are to a large degree only qualitatively comparable, providing challenges for the interpretation of proxy data and/or model sensitivity. With respect to the latter, our results suggest that an assessment of greenhouse worlds is best constrained by temperatures in the midlatitudes.},

Bulk carbonate sampled with 10-15 cm spacing was used for the construction of a continuous carbon isotope curve through the Albian stage. Spectral analyses reveal prominent 400 kyr cyclicity in the $\delta$<sup>13</sup>C curve, which correlates with Milankovitch long eccentricity changes. Cycles occurring in our record resemble those observed in several Cenozoic $\delta$<sup>13</sup>C records, suggesting that a link between orbital forcing and carbon cycling existed also under mid-Cretaceous greenhouse conditions. Based on comparisons with Cenozoic eccentricity-carbon cycle links we hypothesize that 400 kyr cycles in the mid-Cretaceous were related to a fluctuating monsoonal regime, coupled with an unstable oceanic structure, which made the oceanic carbon reservoir sensitive to orbital variations. In the Tethys these oceanographic conditions lasted until the Late Albian, and then were replaced by a more stable circulation mode, less sensitive to orbital forcing. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Changes in atmospheric pCO2 are widely suggested to have played a major role in both the long-term deterioration of Cenozoic climate and many superimposed rapid climate perturbations such as the pivotal Eocene-Oligocene transition. Changes in marine productivity affecting the biological oceanic carbon pump represent one possible cause of past CO2 variability. Here we explore the relationship between ocean gateway change and marine biogeochemistry. Specifically, we use a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-biogeochemical model (IPSL-CM5A) to examine global ocean paleoproductivity changes in response to the opening of Drake Passage. In our simulations, we find that Drake Passage opening yields a spatially uniform decrease in primary productivity in the low-latitude oceans while the high-latitude response is more spatially heterogeneous. Mechanistically, the low-latitude productivity decrease is a consequence of a fundamental reorganization of ocean circulation when Drake Passage opens driven by the isolation of the Southern Ocean from low-latitude water masses. Nutrient depletion in the low latitudes is driven by a marked decrease in the intensity of deep convection in the Southern Ocean, which drives the accumulation of nutrients at depth and their depletion in the intermediate and upper ocean, especially away from sites of subduction. In the high latitudes, the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the model exerts a strong control both on nutrient availability and on regions of deep-water formation. The qualitative agreement between geographically diverse long-term paleoproductivity records and the simulated variations suggests that Drake Passage opening may contribute to the long-term paleoproductivity signal.},

abstract = {Orbital tuning, the process of fitting sedimentary cycles to orbital periodicities, can estimate with high resolution the timing and duration of key events in the geological record. We formulate here orbital tuning as the inverse problem of finding the variation in sedimentation rate that matches sediment cycles with orbital periodicities. Instead of obtaining a single best estimate, we apply a Bayesian formulation and define a probability distribution of sedimentation rate variations that result in powerful orbital periodicities. By sampling this distribution with a Monte Carlo method, we quantify the uncertainty in the inferred sedimentation rates due to uncertainties in the tuning periods and to components of the sedimentary signal that are unrelated to orbital cycles. The method is applied to the chronology of a 30 m interval in the Cismon APTICORE borehole (Southern Alps, Italy) that includes the early Aptian oceanic anoxic event 1a (Selli Level), estimated to last 1.11 ± 0.11 Ma (95% interval). The $\delta$13C record shows a sudden negative shift of about-1‰ at the base of the Selli Level (22-47 ka) followed by a recovery to preshift values in $\sim$240 ka, consistent with a scenario where light carbon is quickly added and then flushed out of the oceanatmosphere system. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Organic-rich sediments are the salient marine sedimentation product in the mid-Cretaceous of the ocean basins formed in the Mesozoic. Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) are discrete and particularly organic-rich intervals within these mid-Cretaceous organic-rich sequences and are defined by pronounced carbon isotope excursions. Marine productivity during OAEs appears to have been enhanced by the increased availability of biolimiting nutrients in seawater due to hydrothermal alteration of submarine basalts in the Pacific and proto-Indian oceans. The exact mechanisms behind the deposition of organic-rich sediments in the mid-Cretaceous are still a matter of discussion, but a hypothesis which is often put forward is that their deposition was a consequence of the coupling of a particular paleogeography with changes in ocean circulation and nutrient supply. In this study, we used a global coupled climate model to investigate oceanic processes that affect the interbasinal exchange of nutrients as well as their spatial distribution and bioavailability. We conclude that the mid-Cretaceous North Atlantic was a nutrient trap as a consequence of an estuarine circulation with respect to the Pacific. Organic-rich sediments in the North Atlantic were deposited below regions of intense upwelling. We suggest that enhanced productivity during OAEs was a consequence of upwelling of Pacific-derived nutrient-rich seawater associated with submarine igneous events. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Previous work has focused on the role of atmospheric heat transport in preventing atmospheric collapse on the nightside for terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zone around M dwarfs. In the present paper, we carry out simulations with a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model to investigate the role of ocean heat transport in climate states of tidally locked habitable exoplanets around M dwarfs. Our simulation results demonstrate that ocean heat transport substantially extends the area of open water along the equator, showing a lobster-like spatial pattern of open water, instead of an "eyeball." For sufficiently high-level greenhouse gases or strong stellar radiation, ocean heat transport can even lead to complete deglaciation of the nightside. Our simulations also suggest that ocean heat transport likely narrows the width of M dwarfs' habitable zone. This study provides a demonstration of the importance of exooceanography in determining climate states and habitability of exoplanets.},

Estimating these limits is a critical prerequisite for understanding the impacts of climate change on the biogeography of coral reefs. Here we used the diagnostic model ReefHab to determine the current environmental tolerance limits for coral reefs and the global distribution of potential coral reef habitats as a function of six factors: temperature, salinity, nitrate, phosphate, aragonite saturation state, and light. To determine these tolerance limits, we extracted maximum and minimum values of all environmental variables in corresponding locations where coral reefs are present. We found that the global, annually averaged tolerance limits for coral reefs are 21.7-29.6 °C for temperature, 28.7-40.4 psu for salinity, 4.51 $\mu$mol L<sup>-1</sup> for nitrate, 0.63 $\mu$mol L<sup>-1</sup> for phosphate, and 2.82 for aragonite saturation state. The averaged minimum light intensity in coral reefs is 450 $\mu$mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The global area of potential reef habitats calculated by the model is 330.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>2</sup>. Compared with previous studies, the tolerance limits for temperature, salinity, and nutrients have not changed much, whereas the minimum value of aragonite saturation in coral reef waters has decreased from 3.28 to 2.82.

A younger origin of Metazoa would require greatly increased substitution rates across many clades and many genes; while not impossible, this is less parsimonious. Yet the first fossil evidence for metazoans (the Doushantuo embryos) about 600 Ma is followed by the Ediacaran fossils after 580 Ma, the earliest undisputed bilaterians at 555 Ma, and an increase in the size and morphologic complexity of bilaterians around 542 Ma. This temporal framework suggests a missing 150–200 Myr of early metazoan history that encompasses many apparent novelties in the early evolution of the nervous system. This span includes two major glaciations, and complex marine geochemical changes including major changes in redox and other environmental changes. One possible resolution is that animals of these still unknown Cryogenian and early Ediacaran ecosystems were relatively simple, with highly conserved developmental genes involved in cell-type specification and simple patterning. In this model, complex nervous systems are a convergent phenomenon in bilaterian clades which occurred close to the time that larger metazoans appeared in the fossil record.},

Sediment transport from three distinct periods are compared: winter, when discharge is very low and regular; the spring snowmelt season, when discharge is high during several weeks, with daily oscillations; and the rest of the year when discharge is controlled by fluctuations in the precipitation regime. It is shown that sediment transport is dominated by the summer and autumn storm events, with the storms of October 1987 accounting for 61% of the bedload transport in seven years. In addition the sediment transport is considered in three components: solutes, suspended sediment load and bedload. In years with a normal pluviometric regime, the ratio between the three modes of sediment transport is between 82 and 94 percent solutes, 5 to 7.5 percent suspended sediments and 1 to 10 per cent bedload. This too varies greatly from year to year, with the October 1987 storms transporting 17 tons of bedload transport whilst the dissolved and suspended load only reached 2,000 and 750 kg respectively. {\textcopyright} 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

A growing body of evidence for a more dynamic evolution of seawater chemistry than previously considered has been building over the past two decades. Central to this body of evidence are oscillating global trends, on a 100- to 200-million-year time scale, in the mineralogy of marine carbonate cements (1), late-stage salts in marine evaporites (2), and calcifying organisms that are interpreted to record secular change in seawater chemistry (3, 4). The degree to which the basic seawater signal has varied over the past 550 million years is, however, an issue that has been strongly debated in the literature (e.g., refs. 5–9). This primarily reflects the arguably equivocal nature of the evidence used to infer secular changes in seawater chemistry and the mechanisms for driving that change. Reconstructions of seawater chemical composition based on marine inorganic precipitate and fossil proxy records may be compromised by the influence of various environmental factors, and by the geochemical insults of diagenesis on their mineralogy and chemical composition (5, 10, 11). Complimentary modeling efforts that focus on constraining the mechanism(s) for driving substantial chemical change in seawater are challenged by the uncertainties associated with defining model input parameters (2, 5, 9). },

abstract = {Normalograptids constitute a distinctive but not easily identified group of derived axonophorans. A new study of Normalograptus morphology indicates that many Late Ordovician taxa previously identified as Normalograptus are actually referable to Styracograptus and related climacograptoids. These re-identifications have led to the recognition of a complex biogeographic history among normalograptids and their descendants, including an interesting pattern that had previously been overlooked - a late Katian disappearance of Normalograptus from the palaeotropics. Normalograptid palaeogeographic distribution in the Ordovician appears to comprise 5 main phases: (1) evolutionary origin probably in relatively high palaeolatitudes in the early to mid Darriwilian; (2) spread to global distribution in later Darriwilian time; (3) retreat from most low palaeolatitude regions during the early Katian, with perhaps a slightly delayed retreat from Laurentia; (4) a complete extirpation from the low palaeolatitudes by the mid Katian (Ea4); (5) reinvasion of the low palaeolatitudes that accompanies the remarkable ecological and evolutionary replacement of the Diplograptina by species of Normalograptus and their descendants during the latest Katian-early Hirnantian. We propose two sets of hypotheses to explain Late Ordovician Normalograptus distribution. First, given the low species diversity of Normalograptus, we suggest as a null hypothesis that the disappearance of normalograptids from low palaeolatitudes during the late Sandbian and early Katian as simply a stochastic outcome-asmallclade simply went extinct by chance alone. The alternative is that the loss of Normalograptus species reflects some form of extinction for cause, either: (1) competitive exclusion; or (2) an inability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In the case of the competitive exclusion hypothesis, the most likely competitors are species of the Diplograptina. {\textcopyright} 2011 Yorkshire Geological Society.},

There were also periods of global warming; for example, the late Ordovician (Middle Ashgill) Boda Event immediately preceded the Hirnantian glaciation. Much has been deduced about Palaeozoic climatic variation for about two hundred years, but it is only since the advent of the understanding of plate tectonics in the 1960s that a coherent picture is beginning to emerge of palaeoclimates around the globe.

abstract = {The maximum size of organisms has increased enormously since the initial appearance of life >3.5 billion years ago (Gya), but the pattern and timing of this size increase is poorly known. Consequently, controls underlying the size spectrum of the global biota have been difficult to evaluate. Our period-level compilation of the largest known fossil organisms demonstrates that maximum size increased by 16 orders of magnitude since life first appeared in the fossil record. The great majority of the increase is accounted for by 2 discrete steps of approximately equal magnitude: the first in the middle of the Paleoproterozoic Era (≈1.9 Gya) and the second during the late Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic eras (0.6-0.45 Gya). Each size step required a major innovation in organismal complexity-first the eukaryotic cell and later eukaryotic multicellularity. These size steps coincide with, or slightly postdate, increases in the concentration of atmospheric oxygen, suggesting latent evolutionary potential was realized soon after environmental limitations were removed. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The Late Ordovician mass extinction (LOME) coincided with dramatic climate changes, but there are numerous ways in which these changes could have driven marine extinctions. We use a palaeobiogeographic database of rhynchonelliform brachiopods to examine the selectivity of Late Ordovician-Early Silurian genus extinctions and evaluate which extinction drivers are best supported by the data. The first (latest Katian) pulse of the LOME preferentially affected genera restricted to deeper waters or to relatively narrow (less than 35°) palaeolatitudinal ranges. This pattern is only observed in the latest Katian, suggesting that it reflects drivers unique to this interval. Extinction of exclusively deeperwater genera implies that changes in water mass properties such as dissolved oxygen content played an important role. Extinction of genera with narrow latitudinal ranges suggests that interactions between shifting climate zones and palaeobiogeography may also have been important. We test the latter hypothesis by estimating whether each genus would have been able to track habitats within its thermal tolerance range during the greenhouse-icehouse climate transition. Models including these estimates are favoured over alternative models. We argue that the LOME, long regarded as non-selective, is highly selective along biogeographic and bathymetric axes that are not closely correlated with taxonomic identity.},

abstract = {Over the past 3.8 billion years, the maximum size of life has increased by approximately 18 orders of magnitude. Much of this increase is associated with two major evolutionary innovations: the evolution of eukaryotes from prokaryotic cells approximately 1.9 billion years ago (Ga), and multicellular life diversifying from unicellular ancestors approximately 0.6 Ga. However, the quantitative relationship between organismal size and structural complexity remains poorly documented. We assessed this relationship using a comprehensive dataset that includes organismal size and level of biological complexity for 11 172 extant genera. We find that the distributions of sizes within complexity levels are unimodal, whereas the aggregate distribution is multimodal. Moreover, both the mean size and the range of size occupied increases with each additional level of complexity. Increases in size range are non-symmetric: the maximum organismal size increases more than the minimum. The majority of the observed increase in organismal size over the history of life on the Earth is accounted for by two discrete jumps in complexity rather than evolutionary trends within levels of complexity. Our results provide quantitative support for an evolutionary expansion away from a minimal size constraint and suggest a fundamental rescaling of the constraints on minimal and maximal size as biological complexity increases.},

abstract = {Climate trends on timescales of 10s to 100s of millions of years are controlled by changes in solar luminosity, continent distribution, and atmosphere composition. Plate tectonics affect geography, but also atmosphere composition through volcanic degassing of CO2 at subduction zones and midocean ridges. So far, such degassing estimates were based on reconstructions of ocean floor production for the last 150 My and indirectly, through sea level inversion before 150 My. Here we quantitatively estimate CO2 degassing by reconstructing lithosphere subduction evolution, using recent advances in combining global plate reconstructions and present-day structure of the mantle. First, we estimate that since the Triassic (250-200 My) until the present, the total pale-osubduction-zone length reached up to ∼200% of the present-day value. Comparing our subduction-zone lengths with previously reconstructed ocean-crust production rates over the past 140 My suggests average global subduction rates have been constant, ∼6 cm/y: Higher ocean-crust production is associated with longer total subduction length. We compute a strontium isotope record based on subduction-zone length, which agrees well with geological records supporting the validity of our approach: The total subduction-zone length is proportional to the summed arc and ridge volcanic CO2 production and thereby to global volcanic degassing at plate boundaries. We therefore use our degassing curve as input for the GEOCARBSULF model to estimate atmospheric CO2 levels since the Triassic. Our calculated CO2 levels for the mid Mesozoic differ from previous modeling results and are more consistent with available proxy data.},

Although there were local precursors, significant glaciation began in the latest Eocene (ca 35 Ma) in eastern Antarctica. It was followed by glaciation in mountain areas through the Miocene (in Alaska, Greenland, Iceland and Patagonia), later in the Pliocene (e.g. in the Bolivian Andes and possibly in Tasmania) and in the earliest Pleistocene (e.g. in the Alps, New Zealand, Iceland and Greenland). Today, evidence from both the land and the ocean floors demonstrates that the major continental glaciations, outside the polar regions, rather than occurring throughout the 2.6 Ma of the Quaternary, were markedly restricted to the last 1 Ma-800 ka or less.

Tsunamigenically dislocated beachrock slabs found on top of the Santa Maura beach ridge complex are closely interrelated to adjacent coarse-grained washover fan deposits encountered in vibracores and detected by earth resistivity measurements. Based on detailed topographic surveys and geomorphometric investigations, it was possible to localize areas of high intensity overflow. Underwater studies revealed that the central and northern parts of the former Plaka beach ridge were completely destroyed by tsunami impact. Loose littoral deposits were flushed into the Bay of Aghios Nikolaos and mega blocks of the underlying beachrock structure were dislocated landwards. Tsunami landfall occurred all along the eastern and northern shores of the bay where deposits, partly weathered and associated to archaeological findings, were found. Runup was estimated to minimum values between 2-3 m and 4-6 m a.s.l. Crosschecking the results of radiocarbon analyses with archaeological ages from five sites allowed to date the strong tsunami event to the time period between 395 cal BC and 247 cal BC. Due to the funnel-like contour of the coastline, the area is extremely sensitive to tsunami events of mid to high magnitude and high frequency. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

abstract = {The limits of predictability of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and upper-ocean temperatures due to errors in ocean initial conditions and model parametrizations are investigated in an idealized configuration of an ocean general circulation model (GCM). Singular vectors (optimal perturbations) are calculated using the GCM, its tangent linear and adjoint models to determine an upper bound on the predictability of North Atlantic climate. The maximum growth time-scales of MOC and upper-ocean temperature anomalies, excited by the singular vectors, are 18.5 and 13 years respectively and in part explained by the westward propagation of upper-ocean anomalies against the mean flow. As a result of the linear interference of non-orthogonal eigenmodes of the non-normal dynamics, the ocean dynamics are found to actively participate in the significant growth of the anomalies. An initial density perturbation of merely 0.02 kg m -3 is found to lead to a 1.7 Sv MOC anomaly after 18.5 years. In addition, Northern Hemisphere upper-ocean temperature perturbations can be amplified by a factor of 2 after 13 years. The growth of upper-ocean temperature and MOC anomalies is slower and weaker when excited by the upper-ocean singular vectors than when the deep ocean is perturbed. This leads to the conclusion that predictability experiments perturbing only the atmospheric initial state may overestimate the predictability time. Interestingly, optimal MOC and upper-ocean temperature excitations are only weakly correlated, thus limiting the utility of SST observations to infer MOC variability. The excitation of anomalies in this model might have a crucial impact on the variability and predictability of Atlantic climate. The limit of predictability of the MOC is found to be different from that of the upper-ocean heat content, emphasizing that errors in ocean initial conditions will affect various measures differently and such uncertainties should be carefully considered in decadal prediction experiments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The influence of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) on rainfall amounts over Equatorial East Africa (Kenya and northern Tanzania) is analysed for the period 1979-95 at the intraseasonal (pentad) time-scale. The two rainy seasons (March to May and October to December) are considered. Intraseasonal wet events in East Africa are embedded in large-scale zonal circulation anomaly patterns along the equator, showing distinct eastward propagation. It is further found that these 'wet' events display a clear phasing with respect to the MJO cycle. This phasing is expressed as out-of-phase variations between the Highland and the coastal areas. Such a pattern is suggested to reflect different rain-causing mechanisms. MJO phases leading to wet spells in the western (Highland) region are those associated with the development of large-scale convection in the Africa/Indian Ocean region. These events are unambiguously related to deep convection, fuelled by low-level westerly moisture advection. MJO phases leading to wet spells in the eastern (coastal) region are often those associated with overall suppressed deep convection in the Africa/Indian Ocean region. However, these phases induce moisture advection from Indian Ocean. The possible role of stratiform rainfall or relatively shallow convection in the coastal wet spells observed in this phase is discussed. The contrasting rainfall conditions found in the two regions for the two opposite MJO phases are strongly correlated with the pressure gradient between the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. {\textcopyright} Royal Meteorological Society, 2006.},

abstract = {The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) was shown in Part I to have a significant impact on both East African rainy seasons at pentad time-scale. The case of the 'long rains' (March-May) is further examined by considering both shorter (daily) and longer (interannual) time-scales. Based on composite analyses, extreme daily rainfall events in the Highland (west) and in the coastal (east) regions of Equatorial East Africa (Kenya and Tanzania) are extracted. Low-level westerly wind anomalies are seen to accompany wet events in the west and easterly ones in the east. These opposite circulation anomalies preferentially occur at distinct phases of the MJO, which indicates that the latter has a major influence on rainfall at the daily time-scale. However, this influence undergoes significant year-to-year variations. It is found that the common variance between smoothed rainfall time series (5-day low-pass filter) and MJO indices varies from 5% to 53% in the Highland region. Significantly lower air temperatures in the upper troposphere are recorded during the MJO cycles that present the highest common variance with East African rainfall. Such a cooling is seen to be related to the Kelvin wave propagation in the upper layers which favours upward atmospheric motion over the region. At the interannual time-scale, fluctuations in MJO amplitude contribute to the March-May rainfall variability, and 44% of the March-May seasonal rainfall variance in the 1979-95 period in East Africa is explained by this parameter. Years of high MJO amplitude are characterized by earlier onset of the rains, and higher seasonal amounts. {\textcopyright} Royal Meteorological Society, 2006.},

One of the limiting factors for existing global models of dust transport, atmospheric processing and deposition is the quality and availability of data to allow evaluation and validation of emission schemes against in situ data from source regions. This review provides a critical overview of recent studies of aeolian processes from within or on dust sources, and focuses on studies dealing with retrieval of dust emission data, quantification of the contribution and variability of dust emissions from specific landforms, and the use of remote sensing data to reconcile dust storm inventories by direct comparison to dust source geomorphology. These case studies highlight significant advances in both field measurement and regional understanding of important components of the dust cycle derived through use of remote sensing data. However, recent research also demonstrates that most source regions exhibit significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in dust emissions from candidate geomorphologies, which has direct implications for strategies aimed at inclusion of dust emission schemes at a scale relevant to climate models. To accommodate these factors and other significant scaling issues, additional research is needed to increase our quantification of a wider range of dust source types and geomorphological contexts over longer time periods. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {During the 1950s and 1960s, an extensive field study and interpretive effort was made by researchers, primarily at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, to sample and understand the physical oceanography of the eastern tropical Pacific. That work was inspired by the valuable fisheries of the region, the recent discovery of the equatorial undercurrent, and the growing realization of the importance of the El Ni{\~{n}}o phenomenon. Here we review what was learned in that effort, and integrate those findings with work published since then as well as additional diagnoses based on modern data sets. Unlike the central Pacific, where the winds are nearly zonal and the ocean properties and circulation are nearly independent of longitude, the eastern tropical Pacific is distinguished by wind forcing that is strongly influenced by the topography of the American continent. Its circulation is characterized by short zonal scales, permanent eddies and significant off-equatorial upwelling. Notably, the Costa Rica Dome and a thermocline bowl to its northwest are due to winds blowing through gaps in the Central American cordillera, which imprint their signatures on the ocean through linear Sverdrup dynamics. Strong annual modulation of the gap winds and the meridional oscillation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone generates a Rossby wave, superimposed on the direct forcing, that results in a southwestward-propagating annual thermocline signal accounting for major features of observed thermocline depth variations, including that of the Costa Rica Dome, the Tehuantepec bowl, and the ridge-trough system of the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC). Interannual variability of sea surface temperature (SST) and altimetric sea surface height signals suggests that the strengthening of the NECC observed in the central Pacific during El Ni{\~{n}}o events continues all the way to the coast, warming SST (by zonal advection) in a wider meridional band than the equatorially trapped thermocline anomalies, and pumping equatorial water poleward along the coast. The South Equatorial Current originates as a combination of equatorial upwelling, mixing and advection from the NECC, and Peru coastal upwelling, but its sources and their variability remain unresolved. Similarly, while much of the Equatorial Undercurrent flows southeast into the Peru Undercurrent and supplies the coastal upwelling, a quantitative assessment is lacking. We are still unable to put together the eastern interconnections among the long zonal currents of the central Pacific.},

abstract = {This paper presents a multi-proxy reconstruction of the climatic and environmental changes during the Last Glacial-Interglacial transition as recorded by a sediment sequence from Lake Lautrey (Jura, eastern France). This reconstruction is based on analysis of pollen, chironomid, organic matter, oxygen-isotope, mineralogical, magnetic susceptibility and inferred lake-level data at a high temporal resolution. The chronology is derived using AMS radiocarbon dates, the position of the Laacher See Tephra (LST), and of correlation between the Lautrey and GRIP oxygen-isotope records. This data set reveals a detailed sequence of environmental changes in the Jura mountains from Greenland Stadial 2a to the early Holocene. Biotic and abiotic indicators allow the recognition of major abrupt changes associated with the GS-2a/GI-1e, GI-1a/GS-1 and GS-1/Preboreal transitions, and other minor fluctuations related to the cold events GI-1d, GI-1b and the Preboreal oscillation (PBO). They also suggest additional cooling spells at ca 14,550 and 14,350 cal yr BP (Intra-B{\o}lling Cold Periods), at ca 13,500 and ca 12,700 cal yr BP just before the GS-1 onset, and at ca 11,350 cal yr BP just before the PBO, as well as an intriguing brief warming episode within GS-1 at ca 12,080 cal yr BP. Summer temperature increased by ca 5 °C at the start of GI-1e, and by 1.5-3°C at the Holocene onset, while it decreased by ca 3-4°C at the beginning of GS-1. Major changes in local hydrology and in seasonality appear to be also associated with the GS-2a/GI-1e, GI-1a/GS-1 and GS-1/Preboreal transitions. Pollen and abiotic indicators suggest a greater sensitivity of the vegetation cover to climatic oscillations during the first part of the Lateglacial Interstadial than during the second part (after ca 13,700 cal yr BP), when a closed forest had been restored in this area. By contrast, the restoration of forest cover took less than 300 yr after the end of GS-1. At the beginning of GI-1e and GS-1, no lag occurs (within the sampling resolution of 20-50 yr) in the responses of aquatic (chironomids) and terrestrial (pollen) ecosystems, while, at the onset of the Holocene, the response of the vegetation appears slightly delayed in comparison with that of the chironomid community. Finally, the recognition of two successive tephra layers, which were deposited just before the LST at ca 12,950 cal yr BP and which originated from Le Puy de la Nug{\`{e}}re (Massif Central, France), provides an additional tephrochronological tool for correlation between Lateglacial European sequences. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The geomorphology and sedimentology of a series of Late Midlandian glacigenic sites in Connemara, western Ireland, are described and a set of commonly occurring sedimentary assemblages identified. These form components of a simple model of ice-contact subaqueous sedimentation involving progressive down current transition from subglacial esker tunnel fill, through proximal tunnel-mouth fans, proximal and distal subaqueous fans into basin floor sediments. In two of the sites aggradation to the water-line passes into fan-delta topsets and foresets. All sites abut into inferred water bodies to their west and imply minimum water-surface heights of between 35 and 65 m Irish OD or, in the case of the two deltaic sites, shoreline heights of between 75 and 80 m. These high water levels, very close to, and facing directly into, the immediately adjacent open Atlantic Ocean are difficult to explain as ice-dammed glaciolacustrine water bodies without invoking improbable ice-sheet marginal geometries. They may, however, be explained as a set of successive 'fjord-head' grounding-line depositional systems that trace temporary still-stands in the phased retreat of the Irish Ice Sheet from its offshore maximum. This possibility, not yet confirmed by the discovery of in situ marine fauna, implies a degree of Late Midlandian isostatic depression and subsequent response unexplained by currently applied crustal response models but supported by previously constructed glacio-sedimentary models. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Outcrops of pebbly mud (diamict) at Scarborough in Southern Ontario, Canada (the so-called Sunnybrook 'Till') are associated with the earliest incursion of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) into mid-continent North America some 45,000 years ago. The Sunnybrook is a blanket-like deposit containing deepwater ostracodes and occurs conformably within a thick (100 m) succession of deltaic and glaciolacustrine facies that record water depth changes in a large proglacial lake. Contextual evidence (associated facies, sedimentary structures, deposit geometry and landforms) indicates a low energy depositional setting in an ice-dammed ancestral Lake Ontario in which scouring by floating ice masses was an important process. U-shaped, iceberg-cut scours (with lateral berms) up to 7 m deep, occur on the upper surface of the Sunnybrook and are underlain by 'sub-scour' structures that extend several meters below the scour base. Ice-rafted concentrations of clasts ('clast layers'), grooved surfaces formed by floating ice glissading over a muddy lake floor ('soft sediment striations') and melanges of sand and mud mixed by grounding ice keels ('ice keel turbates') are present and are all well known from modern cold environments. The wider significance of this depositional model is that the LIS margin lay east of Scarborough and did not overrun Southern Ontario. This finding is in agreement with recent data from the Erie Basin of Canada, Ohio, and Indiana where deposits formerly correlated with the Sunnybrook (and thus implying an extensive early Wisconsin ice sheet) are now regarded as Illinoian. A speculative hypothesis is proposed that relates deposition of the Sunnybrook and two younger deposits of similar sedimentology, to surge-like instabilities of the southern LIS margin. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by University of Washington.},

abstract = {Deep-sea sediment cores recovered from the Northeast Atlantic Ocean were examined in order to elucidate the influence of the Earth's orbital parameters on major ice rafting. Analyses of coarse-grained ice-rafted debris and planktonic foraminifers revealed a strong reaction to the precession signal. Since 130,000 yr B.P., dropstone layers have been deposited each half period of a precessional cycle (11,000 ± 1000 yr). Ice rafting occurs during times of winter minimum/summer maximum insolation and summer minimum/winter maximum insolation. In the first case, high summer insolation forces meltwater discharge from the ice sheets into the polar seas which subsequently enhances formation of sea ice during the winter. In the second case, growth of continental ice enhances iceberg production which also leads to a salinity reduction of surface seawater. Both situations result in a southward penetration of polar water. Thus, the marine record of dropstones documents ice rafting not only during Weichselian stades but also during cold events within interstades. The regularity of ice rafting yields a useful framework to calibrate and elucidate climatic changes, not only in the region of the North Atlantic Ocean but also in remote areas such as the Pacific Ocean and the Antarctic. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

Sediment yield is computed from three factors: (1) the size of the sediment source area, (2) the length of time the system operated, and (3) the volume of sediment trapped. The sediment budget of the lake system suggests a detrital sediment yield of 4400 ± 1700 metric tons per square kilometer and per calendar year. This represents a denudation rate of 1.6 ± 0.6 mm per year, illustrating that mechanical erosion by the Jura glacier is more intensive than other processes of erosion. {\textcopyright} 2001 University of Washington.},

The model differs from previous models by using shifts in Hadley circulation caused by orbital variations, and the rotation rate of the Earth, to locate the position of the planetary oceanic low-and high-pressure systems, around which the planetary ocean surface currents flow. Adapting the model to the Arenig (early Ordovician) the temperate low pressure zones were found to be located at 50 latitude and the subtropical high pressure zones at 25°latitude. Traditionally, most Palaeozoic palaeogeographical reconstructions are reconstructed using palaeomagnetic data supplemented with data from climate-sensitive lithofacies and palaeo-biogeographical distributions. However, as a new approach in palaeogeographical reconstructions, the conceptual palaeo-oceanographical model is combined with palaeobiogeographical data for the Arenig series, complementing the palaeomagnetic data, and resulting in a new, refined palaeogeographical reconstruction.},

Here a very simple model-based method is described for deducing the modern spatial distribution of basal sliding coefficients. The model is run forward in time, and the basal sliding coefficient at each grid point is periodically increased or decreased depending on whether the local ice surface elevation is too high or too low compared to observed in areas of unfrozen bed. The method considerably reduces large-scale errors in Antarctic ice elevation, from several 100s to several 10s of meters in most regions. Remaining ice elevation errors over mountain ranges such as the Transantarctics are further improved by parameterizing the possible effect of sub-grid topography in the basal sliding law, representing sliding in deep valleys. Results are compared with modern velocity data, and various sensitivity tests are described in Appendices. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {The making of Pangea is the result of large-scale amalgamation of continents and micro-continents, which started at the end of the Neoproterozoic with the formation of Gondwana. As pieces were added to Gondwana on its South-American, Antarctica and Australia side, ribbon-like micro-continents were detached from its African and South-Chinese side: Cadomia in the late Neoproterozoic, Avalonia and Hunia in the Ordovician, Galatia in the Devonian and Cimmeria in the Permian. Cadomia was re-accreted to Gondwana, but the other ribbon-continents were accreted to Baltica, North-China, Laurussia or Laurasia. Finding the origin of these numerous terranes is a major geological challenge. Recently, a global plate tectonic model was developed together with a large geological/geodynamic database, at the Lausanne University, covering the last 600. Ma of the Earth's history. Special attention was given to the placing of Gondwana derived terranes in their original position, using all possible constraints. We propose here a solution for the Variscan terranes, another paper deals with the Altaids. The Galatian super-terrane was detached from Gondwana in the Devonian, during the opening of Paleotethys, and was quickly separated into four sub-terranes that started to by-pass each other. The leading terranes collided at the end of the Devonian with the Hanseatic terrane detached from Laurussia. In the Carboniferous, Gondwana started to impinge onto the amalgamated terranes, creating the Variscan chain and the Pangean super-continent. East of Spain Paleotethys remained opened until the Triassic, subducting northward under Laurasia. Roll-back of the Paleotethyan slab triggered the collapse of most of the European Variscan orogen, which was replaced by series of Permian rifts, some of them becoming oceanized back-arc basins during the Triassic. Major force changes at the Pangean plate limits at the end of the Triassic provoked its break-up, through the opening of the proto-Caribbean, central-Atlantic, Alpine-Tethys oceanic seaways. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The compensation between the meridional heat transports in the atmosphere and ocean is studied through a coupled model's water-hosing experiments. It is found that the atmospheric heat transport (AHT) change compensates the oceanic heat transport (OHT) change very well in the extratropics, while the former overcompensates the latter in the tropics. Similar to previous studies, the fresh water input in the high latitude Atlantic weakens the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and thus the northward Atlantic OHT significantly, leading to a warming (cooling) in sea surface temperature in the Southern (Northern) Hemisphere and in turn a southward shift of atmospheric convection. This results in an enhanced Hadley Cell (HC) and stronger northward AHT, compensating the reduced Atlantic OHT. Meanwhile, the wind-driven Subtropical Cell in the Indo-Pacific oceans is enhanced in response to the HC change, increasing the northward OHT in the Indo-Pacific, which partly offsets the reduced OHT in the Atlantic. The response in the Indo-Pacific is responsible for the overcompensation of the AHT to the global OHT. The Held's mechanism works very well in the tropical Indo-Pacific in our experiments. This is substantially different from previous studies. {\textcopyright}2013 H. Yang et al.},

abstract = {We present a model in which the Carribean plate is an intra-American feature formed along the Caribbean spreading center as opposed to the current model that considers the Caribbean plate as a far-travelled crustal segment that formed in the Pacific region. Paleomagnetic data, which cover an age range from Jurassic through Paleocene, indicate the ophiolite complexes in Costa Rica and Panama formed in an equatorial position. The ophiolites did not fundamentally change their position relative to South America since their origin. Basaltic rocks of the lower part of the ophiolites are of mid-ocean ridge type suggesting formation at a spreading-center. They are interpreted to have formed as part of the proto-Caribbean crust at a spreading axis in an intra-American position during Jurassic and Early Cretaceous times. The upper part of the ophiolites is mainly built up by island arc and intraplate basalts. The island arc basalts evolved at the Central American landbridge which started in the Middle Cretaceous. The intraplate basalts are related to the Caribbean plateau basalt which thickened and stiffened the Caribbean crust in Middle Cretaceous to probably Campanian times. Changes in relative plate motions along the Middle American convergent plate margin are reflected by orientations and time sequences of paleostress tensors calculated from fault-slip data in southern Mexico and Costa Rica. Kinematic indicators from mylonite zones display sinistral movement along secondary shear zones within the southern Mexican crustal complexes and along the northern boundary of the Chortis block in the Motagua-Polochic fault system. This reflects the eastward drift of the Chortis block since the beginning of the Cenozoic. At this time the Chortis block became part of the Carribean plate which moved more than 1000 km towards the east relative to the North and South American plates during the Cenozoic.},

abstract = {The Ivory Coast-Ghana margin is a typical transform margin along which large-scale tectonism has been well documented. The Cretaceous sediments of the Ivory Coast-Ghana transform margin were subjected to numerous tectonic, gravitational, and hydrothermal forces during lithification. In this paper, we infer the order of occurrence of deformation regimes from characteristic deformations observed in samples of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 159. Three main types of minor scale deformation are identified and characterized in terms of geometry, rheology, and kinematics: (1) extensional structures such as normal faults and irregular veins with angular, indented walls that are widely recorded at all ODP sites; (2) compressional structures that are confined to the marginal ridge of the Ivory Coast-Ghana transform margin and include reverse faults, folds, and vertical crenulation cleavage and (3) various types of shear zone at low angles with respect to bedding, which are continuous throughout the Cretaceous succession of the ridge. Structural analysis combined with thin section observation shows that most of these deformations occurred in water-rich sediments. The extensional, minorscale structures are related to the Early Cretaceous rifting stage of the margin as characterized at regional scale by half-grabens and tilted blocks. The compressional structures observed in the samples are attributed to Turonian-Santonian positive inversion tectonics and related to the occurrence of large-scale flower structures and inverted extensional blocks. In contrast, the shear zones at low angles with respect to bedding observed throughout the Cretaceous series are linked to local gravity-induced tectonics.},

Three maps have been prepared for each interval in this study: a plate tectonic map, a facies and structural form map, and a petroleum source-rock map. Analysis of the maps indicates that several primary factors controlled the areal distribution of source rocks, their quality, and their effectiveness. These factors are geologic age, paleolatitude of the depositional areas, structural (morphotectonic) forms in which the source rocks were deposited, and the evolution of biota. -from Authors},

abstract = {Icebergs have a potential impact on climate since they release freshwater over a widespread area and cool the ocean due to the take-up of latent heat. Yet, so far, icebergs have never been modelled using an ice-sheet model coupled to a global climate model. Thus, in climate models their impact on climate has been restricted to the ocean. In this study, we investigate the effect of icebergs on the climate of the mid- to high latitudes and the Greenland ice sheet itself within a fully coupled ice-sheet (GRenoble model for Ice Shelves and Land Ice, or GRISLI)-earth-system (<i>i</i>LOVECLIM) model set-up under pre-industrial climate conditions. This set-up enables us to dynamically compute the calving sites as well as the ice discharge and to close the water cycle between the climate and the cryosphere model components. Further, we analyse the different impact of moving icebergs compared to releasing the ice discharge at the calving sites directly. We performed a suite of sensitivity experiments to investigate the individual role of the different factors that influence the impact of the ice release on the ocean: release of ice discharge as icebergs versus as freshwater fluxes, and freshening and latent heat effects. We find that icebergs enhance the sea-ice thickness around Greenland, thereby cooling the atmosphere and increasing the Greenland ice sheet's height. Melting the ice discharge directly at the calving sites, thereby cooling and freshening the ocean locally, results in a similar ice-sheet configuration and climate as the simulation where icebergs are explicitly modelled. Yet, the simulation where the ice discharge is released into the ocean at the calving sites while taking up the latent heat homogeneously underestimates the cooling effect close to the ice-sheet margin and overestimates it further away, thereby causing a reduced ice-sheet thickness in southern Greenland. We conclude that in our fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere model set-up the spatial distribution of the take-up of latent heat related to iceberg melting has a bigger impact on the climate than the input of the iceberg's meltwater. Moreover, we find that icebergs affect the ice sheet's geometry even under pre-industrial equilibrium conditions due to their enhancing effect on sea ice, which causes a colder prevailing climate.},

abstract = {Global carbonate accumulation rates on the surface of the earth, including not only platforms but also continental margin slopes and deep-sea from the Cretaceous to Present, are estimated by compiling previous geologic studies. These rates are revised, taking account of the erosional effect of the sediments on the platform and deep-sea. Long-term model carbonate fluxes from the ocean to the crust are calculated on the basis of the carbon cycle model (GEOCARB of Berner 1991). The rates based on the actual geologic data indicate much lower values than model fluxes, excluding the Pliocene and Quaternary. The discrepancy could be attributed to the two misunderstandings, namely an overestimate of carbonate accumulation rate for the Quaternary and an incorrect use of the higher Quaternary rate for a boundary condition of the model. The carbonate accumulation rate for the Pliocene to Quaternary is lowered from 29.8 × 1018 mol/Ma (modified from Opdyke & Wilkinson 1988) to 14.8 × 1018 mol/Ma in the present study, assuming that the rate from Quaternary to Pliocene is almost the same as the Miocene value. New model fluxes are recalculated with the new boundary condition in the Quaternary (14.8 × 1018 mol/Ma). Revised model fluxes show general trends of high rates in 120 Ma or 130 Ma, and a low rate in 0 Ma, and are in agreement with the accumulation rate pattern.},

abstract = {This paper quantitatively explores, in terms of roughness indices, the effect of soil surface irregularities on the diurnal variation of the broadband blue-sky albedo of a large range of soil properties. Field studies were carried out on cultivated and uncultivated soil surfaces in Poland and Israel that vary in roughness and brightness. It was found that these irregularities, formed by different agricultural equipment and modified by rain or sprinkler irrigation, can be quantified by two roughness indices. Soil roughness not only affects the overall level of the diurnal variation of the albedo, but also affects the intensity of the diurnal increase from the solar zenith angle ($\theta$s) at the local noon to about 75° - 80°. The roughness indices are variables that precisely determine only the albedo at the local solar noon of soils with the same color value. If the contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) and calcium carbonate are treated as the dominant variables, combined with one of the indices, these three variables together would significantly describe the albedo at the local solar noon of all soil surfaces. The soils, with their high irregularities, showed almost no rising values of albedo at a $\theta$s lower than 75°, while the smooth soil surfaces exhibited a gradual increase of the albedo at these angles. It is concluded that the roughness indices provide sufficient means to accurately describe the diurnal variation of the albedo of a wide range of surfaces, disregarding other soil properties.},

Evidence for grounded ice sheets is preserved at the both the southeastern (Jabal Azbah) and northern (Jabal az-Zalmah) basin margins. Characteristic soft-sediment deformation structures, including soft-sediment folds, small-scale faults and striated pavements indicate subglacial shearing and the formation of glacial erosion surfaces. These findings support the presence of a Late Ordovician ice margin in the eastern Sahara and add vital new constraints to reconstructions of the morphology of North African grounded ice sheets. Prior to our study, there existed two plausible models on ice sheet geometry. The first was that separate ice sheets - namely a north and west African ice sheet and an Arabian ice sheet - extended over this part of western North Gondwana. The second was that ice cover was continuous. The presence of a suite of subglacially-generated deformation structures adds considerable credence to the latter interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Tassili-n-Ajjers area in southern Algeria is located in the south-east of the Saharan platform. It is bounded to the east by the Tihemboka N-S trending structural system, the Hoggar shield to the south and to the north by the Illizi Basin. During the Palaeozoic, the Saharan Platform was part of the northern passive margin of the Gondwana supercontinent and the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of sedimentary systems in the Algerian Sahara was typical of the Gondwana stable cratonic platform. During the Late Ashgill (Hirnantian), the North African platform was located near the South Pole and an icecap developed over much of Africa and South America. Field observations, in the study area, together with integrated strain analysis and previous studies provide evidence for a number of Late Ordovician deformation phases. An extensional event of probably Late Caradoc-Early Ashgill age (?) was associated with the development of planar domino-style normal faults and listric faults that occurred prior to the infill of glacial palaeovalleys. This is observed in the pre-glacial In-Tahouite Formation. Glaciotectonic over the Tassilli-n-Ajjers is related to the Late Ashgillian (Hirnantian stage) Taconic event. Probably, the Taconic unconformity is a combination of traditional tectonic movements and glaciotectonics. Many soft-sediment deformation structures are attributed to glaciotectonic process. A systematic description of these deformation structures and strain analysis show that there are two types of deformation, pure shear at the top of the Hirnantian syn-glacial Tamadjert Formation and simple shear in the basal part and there are two types of glaciotectonic deformation. The first type at the base is the subglacial deformation and is characterized by simple shear strain and extensional tectonics. The second type at the top is characterized by pure shear strain and compressional tectonics and consists on proglacial deformation. The glacial palaeovalleys show a gravity-sliding mechanism affecting the unconsolidated deposits. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The transition from the last glacial and beginning of B{\o}lling-Aller{\o}d and Pre-Boreal periods in particular is marked by rapid increases in atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations. The CH4 concentrations reached during these intervals, ∼650-750 ppb, is twice that at the last glacial maximum and is not exceeded until the onset of industrialization at the end of the Holocene. Periods of rapid sea-level rise as the Last Glacial Maximum ice sheets retreated and associated with 'melt-water pulses' appear to coincide with the onset of elevated concentrations of CH4, suggestive of a potential causative link. Here we identify and outline a mechanism involving the flooding of the continental shelves that were exposed and vegetated during the glacial sea-level low stand and that can help account for some of these observations. Specifically, we hypothesize that waterlogging (and later, flooding) of large tracts of forest and savanna in the Tropics and Subtropics during the deglacial transition and early Holocene would have resulted in rapid anaerobic decomposition of standing biomass and emission of methane to the atmosphere. This novel mechanism, akin to the consequences of filling new hydroelectric reservoirs, provides a mechanistic explanation for the apparent synchronicity between rate of sea-level rise and occurrence of elevated concentrations of ice core CH4. However, shelf flooding and the creation of transient wetlands are unlikely to explain more than ∼60ppb of the increase in atmospheric CH4 during the deglacial transition, requiring additional mechanisms to explain the bulk of the glacial to interglacial increase. Similarly, this mechanism has the potential also to play some role in the rapid changes in atmospheric methane associated with the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

They inhabited the highest paleolatitude known for a bryozoan fauna during the Ordovician, estimated at more than 65-70°S. A total of 11 species of the genera Anaphragma, Atactoporella, Homotrypa, Monotrypa, Monticulipora, and Prasopora are described. Three species are already known from the equatorial-tropical paleocontinents of Baltica, Laurentia, and Siberia: Anaphragma mirabile, Monotrypa jewensis, and Prasopora falesi. Four new taxa are described:Anaphragma undulata, Atactoporella moroccoensis, Monticulipora globulata, and Monticulipora irregularis. The two species of Anaphragma and the one of Atactoporella display significantly larger zoarial sizes than congeneric species, representing gigantism among bryozoans. Polar gigantism is rejected for the two species of Anaphragma as is gigantism related to photosynthetic endosymbionts. An alternative proposal for their giant size is their long zoarial life span due to their well-balanced, robust branching form, with a relatively wide basal supporting surface, adapted to unconsolidated substrates in environments below wave base. Their great stability in outer-ramp environments, with infrequent storms, would allow the zoaria to grow for an extended time and reach large sizes before being overturned and buried. Atactoporella moroccoensis, has both zoaria and zooecia gigantic, suggesting a hypothesis of polar gigantism.},

abstract = {Recent observations of summer Arctic sea ice over the satellite era show that record or near-record lows for the ice extent occurred in the years 2002-05. To determine the physical processes contributing to these changes in the Arctic pack ice, model results from a regional coupled ice-ocean model have been analyzed. Since 1988 the thickness of the simulated basinwide ice thinned by 1.31 m or 43%. The thinning is greatest along the coast in the sector from the Chukchi Sea to the Beaufort Sea to Greenland. It is hypothesized that the thinning since 1988 is due to preconditioning, a trigger, and positive feedbacks: 1) the fall, winter, and spring air temperatures over the Arctic Ocean have gradually increased over the last 50 yr, leading to reduced thickness of first-year ice at the start of summer; 2) a temporary shift, starting in 1989, of two principal climate indexes (the Arctic Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) caused a flushing of some of the older, thicker ice out of the basin and an increase in the summer open water extent; and 3) the increasing amounts of summer open water allow for increasing absorption of solar radiation, which melts the ice, warms the water, and promotes creation of thinner first-year ice, ice that often entirely melts by the end of the subsequent summer. Internal thermodynamic changes related to the positive ice-albedo feedback, not external forcing, dominate the thinning processes over the last 16 yr. This feedback continues to drive the thinning after the climate indexes return to near-normal conditions in the late 1990s. The late 1980s and early 1990s could be considered a tipping point during which the ice-ocean system began to enter a new era of thinning ice and increasing summer open water because of positive feedbacks. It remains to be seen if this era will persist or if a sustained cooling period can reverse the processes. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

Reversing the conventional approach of computing the ocean as an atmospheric model residual is done to permit calculation of a preliminary uncertainty estimate for the atmospheric flux. The structure of the ERBE errors is itself an important uncertainty. Total energy transport is almost indistinguishable from a hemispherically antisymmetric analytic function, despite the great asymmetry of the oceanic heat fluxes. ERBE data appear sufficiently noisy so that a considerable range of atmospheric transports remains possible: the maximum atmospheric value lies between 3 and 5 PW in the Northern Hemisphere, at one standard deviation, although the values are sensitive to the noise assumptions made here. The Northern Hemisphere ocean and atmosphere carry comparable poleward heat fluxes to about 28°N where the oceanic flux drops rapidly, but does not actually vanish until the oceanic surface area goes to zero. Within the estimated error bars, there is a remarkable antisymmetry about the equator of the combined ocean and atmospheric transports, despite the marked oceanic transport asymmetry. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {New estimates of the poleward energy transport based on atmospheric reanalyses from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are presented. The analysis focuses on the period from February 1985 to April 1989 when there are reliable top-of-the-atmosphere radiation data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment. Annual mean poleward transports of atmospheric energy peak at 5.0 ± 0.14 PW at 43°N and with similar values near 40°S, which is much larger than previous estimates. The standard deviation of annual and zonal mean variability from 1979 to 1998 is mostly less than 0.15 PW (1%-3%). Results are evaluated by computing the implied ocean heat transports, utilizing physical constraints, and comparing them with direct oceanographic estimates and those from successful stable coupled climate models that have been run without artificial flux adjustments for several centuries. Reasonable agreement among ocean transports is obtained with the disparate methods when the results from NCEP-NCAR reanalyses based upon residually derived (not model-generated) methods are used, and this suggests that improvements have occurred and convergence is to the true values. Atmospheric transports adjusted for spurious subterranean transports over land areas are inferred and show that poleward ocean heat transport are dominant only between 0° and 17°N. At 35° latitude, at which the peak total poleward transport in each hemisphere occurs, the atmospheric transport accounts for 78% of the total in the Northern Hemisphere and 92% in the Southern Hemisphere. In general, a much greater portion of the required poleward transport is contributed by the atmosphere than the ocean, as compared with previous estimates.},

The model includes a land-surface transfer component (LSX) that accounts for the physical effects of vegetation. The atmospheric general circulation model is derived from the NCAR CCM1 and modified to include semi-Lagrangian transport of water vapor, subgrid plume convection, PBL mixing, a more complex cloud scheme, and a diurnal cycle. The surface models consist of LSX; multilayer models of soil, snow, and sea ice; sea ice dynamics; and a slab mixed layer ocean.

abstract = {As anthropogenic greenhouse warming occurs in the next century, changes in the mass balances of Greenland and Antarctica will probably accelerate and may have significant effects on global sea level. Recent trends and possible future changes in these mass balances have received considerable attention in the glaciological literature, but until recently relatively few general circulation modeling (GCM) studies have focused on the problem. However, there are two significant problems in using GCMs to predict mass balance distributions on ice sheets: (i) the relatively coarse GCM horizontal resolution truncates the topography of the ice-sheet flanks and smaller ice sheets such as Greenland, and (ii) the snow and ice physics in most GCMs does not include ice-sheet-specific processes such as the refreezing of meltwater. Two techniques are described that attack these problems, involving (i) an elevation-based correction to the surface meteorology and (ii) a simple a posteriori correction for the refreezing of meltwater following Pfeffer et al. Using these techniques in a new version 2 of the Global Environmental and Ecological Simulation of Interactive Systems global climate model, the authors present global climate and ice-sheet mass-balance results from two equilibrated runs for present and doubled atmospheric CO2. This GCM is well suited for ice-sheet mass-balance studies because (a) the surface can be represented at a finer resolution (2° lat × 2° long) than the atmospheric GCM, (b) the two correction techniques are included as part of the model, and (c) the model's mass balances for present-day Greenland and Antarctica are realistic. When atmospheric CO2 is doubled, the net annual surface mass balance decreases on Greenland from +13 to -12 cm yr-1 and increases on Antarctica from +18 to +21 cm yr-1. The corresponding changes in the ice-sheet contributions to global sea level are +1.2 and -1.3 mm yr-1, respectively, yielding a combined contribution of -0.1 mm yr-1. That would be a very minor component of the total sea level rise of ∼5 mm yr-1 expected in the next century, mainly from thermal expansion of the oceans and melting of smaller glaciers. However, biases in the GCM climate suggest a range of uncertainty in the ice-sheet contribution from about -2 to +1 mm yr-1.},

abstract = {Aim: To test for the phylogenetic conservatism of geographic range size and to explore the effect of the environment on this potential conservatism. Location: The western Tethys Ocean and its surroundings (present-day Europe, the Middle East and North Africa) during the early Pliensbachian (Early Jurassic). Methods: Using 104 localities and 1,765 occurrences of ammonite species, we estimated geographic range sizes using the extent of occurrence and the latitudinal range. The phylogenetic conservatism of range sizes was tested using Moran's I index which measures phylogenetic autocorrelation, and Pagel's $\lambda$ which indicates whether a phylogeny correctly predicts covariance patterns among taxa on a given trait according to a Brownian evolution model. We conducted these analyses for two neighbouring provinces with contrasting environmental features (Mediterranean and Northwest European). We also explored scale effects by considering the whole western Tethys and two temporal resolutions (chronozone and sub-stage). Results: A marked difference in phylogenetic signal is observed between Mediterranean (MED) and Northwest European (NWE) species; the range size of MED species is more frequently phylogenetically conserved than that of NWE species. No phylogenetic conservatism of species range size is observed during the last chronozone of the early Pliensbachian which is characterized by numerous palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental changes. Main conclusions: Species range size may be partly determined by phylogeny, but this phylogenetic conservatism is modulated by spatio-temporal environmental stability. The phylogenetic signal of species range size may be labile through time within the same lineage and may differ between contemporaneous species of the same group. This lability stems from the fact that species range size results from a complex interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.},

River basins are defined by the direction files. The river flow leaving each grid box depends on river and lake mass, downstream distance, and an effective flow speed that depends on topography. As input the routing model uses monthly land source runoff from a 5-yr simulation of the NASA/GISS atmospheric climate model (Hansen et al.).

Comparing results from simulations with and without the 9 topographic ridge, it is shown that the zonal baroclinic transport in the channel increases 10 with increasing wind stress when the bottom topography is flat, but not when there is a 11 meridional ridge. The saturation of transport for increasing wind occurs in conjunction with 12 the development of recirculating gyres in the large scale barotropic streamfunction. This 13 suggests that the total circulation can be thought of as a superposition of a gyre mode 14 (which has zero circumpolar transport) and a free circumpolar mode (which contains all 15 of the transport). Basin-like gyres arise in the channel, because the topography steers the 16 barotropic streamlines and supports a frictional boundary layer similar to the more familiar 17 ones observed along western boundaries. The gyre mode is thus closely linked with the 18 bottom form stress exerted by the along ridge flow and provides the sink for the wind 19 momentum input. In this framework, any increase in wind forcing spins a stronger gyre as 20 opposed to feeding the circumpolar transport. This hypothesis is supported with a suite of 21 experiments where key parameters are carried over a wide range: wind stress, wind stress 22 curl, ridge height, channel length, and bottom friction.},

abstract = {The role of tectonic Southern Ocean gateway changes in driving Antarctic climate change at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary remains a topic of debate. One approach taken in previous idealized modeling studies of gateway effects has been to alter modern boundary conditions, whereby the Drake Passage becomes closed. Here, the authors follow this approach but vary atmospheric pCO2 over a range of values when comparing gateway configurations. They find a significantly greater sensitivity of Antarctic temperatures to Southern Ocean gateway changes when atmospheric pCO2 is high than when concentrations are low and the ambient climate is cool. In particular, the closure of the Drake Passage (DP) gap is a necessary condition for the existence of ice-free Antarctic conditions at high CO2 concentrations in this coupled climate model. The absence of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is particularly conducive to warm Antarctic conditions at higher CO2 concentrations, which is markedly different from previous simulations conducted under present-day CO2 conditions. The reason for this is the reduction of sea ice associated with higher CO2. Antarctic sea surface temperature and surface air temperature warming due to a closed DP gap reach values around $\sim$5° and $\sim$7°C, respectively, for high concentrations of CO2 (above 1250 ppm). In other words, the authors find a significantly greater sensitivity of Antarctic temperatures to atmospheric CO2 concentration when the DP is closed compared to when it is open. The presence of a DP gap inhibits a return to warmer and more Eocene-like Antarctic and deep ocean conditions, even under enhanced atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Composite maps of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies over the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) cycle show marked intraseasonal fluctuations over southern Africa (south of 15°S). Large-scale convective clusters are seen to propagate eastward and then northward over the continent, mainly between 10° and 20°S. The corresponding response of the rainfall field presents the alternation, over the cycle, of dry and humid phases, which are both significant. Moisture flux anomalies indicate an intraseasonal modulation of the midtropospheric easterly flow over the Congo basin at 700 hPa; these fluctuations are coupled to meridional flux anomalies that extend from the tropical to the subtropical austral latitudes, and favor occurrences of wet or dry conditions over the domain. Though statistically significant, the influence of the MJO on southern Africa is however not homogeneous spatially, and only the tropical areas exhibit sharp periodicities in the 30-60-day period range. The OLR dipole observed in previous studies at the interannual and synoptic time scales between the hinterland parts of southern Africa and the southwestern Indian Ocean in the north of Madagascar is investigated next, as it also shows strong fluctuations at the intraseasonal time scale. The study points out that the dipole is partly influenced by the MJO, though the strongest periodicities are found for slightly longer periods (35-80 days) than those typically associated with the oscillation. The forcing of the MJO on the OLR dipole, though significant, remains thus partial. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Feedback analysis in climate models commonly involves decomposing any change in the system's energy balance into radiative forcing terms due to prescribed changes, and response terms due to the radiative effects of changes in model variables such as temperature, water vapor, clouds, sea ice, and snow. The established "partial radiative perturbation" (PRP) method allows an accurate separation of these terms, but requires processing large volumes of model output with an offline version of the model's radiation code. Here, we propose an "approximate PRP (APRP) method for the shortwave that provides an accurate estimate of the radiative perturbation, but derived from a quite modest amount of monthly mean model output. The APRP method is based on a simplified sho rtwave radiative model of the atmosphere, where surface absorption and atmospheric scattering and absorption are represented by means of three parameters that are diagnosed for overcast and clear-sky portions of each model grid cell. The accuracy of the method is gauged relative to full PRP calculations in two experiments: one in which carbon dioxide concentration is doubled and another in which conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are simulated. The approximate PRP method yields a shortwave cloud feedback accurate in the global mean to within 7%. Forcings and feedbacks due to surface albedo and noncloud atmospheric constituents are also well approximated with errors of order 5%-10%. Comparison of two different model simulations of the LGM shows that the regional and global differences in their ice sheet albedo forcing fields are clearly captured by the APRP method. Hence this method is an efficient and satisfactory tool for studying and intercomparing shortwave forcing and feedbacks in climate models. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

The simulated THC response to idealized freshwater perturbations and the associated climate changes have been intercompared as an activity of World Climate Research Program (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project/ Paleo-Modeling Intercomparison Project (CMIP/PMIP) committees. This intercomparison among models ranging from the earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) to the fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) seeks to document and improve understanding of the causes of the wide variations in the modeled THC response. The robustness of particular simulation features has been evaluated across the model results. In response to 0.1-Sv (1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s-1) freshwater input in the northern North Atlantic, the multimodel ensemble mean THC weakens by 30% after 100 yr. All models simulate some weakening of the THC, but no model simulates a complete shutdown of the THC. The multimodel ensemble indicates that the surface air temperature could present a complex anomaly pattern with cooling south of Greenland and warming over the Barents and Nordic Seas. The Atlantic ITCZ tends to shift southward. In response to 1.0-Sv freshwater input, the THC switches off rapidly in all model simulations. A large cooling occurs over the North Atlantic. The annual mean Atlantic ITCZ moves into the Southern Hemisphere. Models disagree in terms of the reversibility of the THC after its shutdown. In general, the EMICs and AOGCMs obtain similar THC responses and climate changes with more pronounced and sharper patterns in the AOGCMs. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is analyzed using the reanalysis zonal wind- and satellite outgoing longwave radiation-based indices of Wheeler and Hendon for the 1974-2005 period. The average lifetime of the MJO events varies with season (36 days for events whose central date occurs in December, and 48 days for events in September). The lifetime of the MJO in the equinoctial seasons (March-May and October-December) is also dependent on the state of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During October-December it is only 32 days under El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions, increasing to 48 days under La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions, with similar values in northern spring. This difference is due to faster eastward propagation of the MJO convective anomalies through the Maritime Continent and western Pacific during El Ni{\~{n}}o, consistent with theoretical arguments concerning equatorial wave speeds. The analy sis is extended back to 1950 by using an alternative definition of the MJO based on just the zonal wind component of the Wheeler and Hendon indices. A rupture in the amplitude of the MJO is found in 1975, which is at the same time as the well-known rupture in the ENSO time series that has been associated with the Pacific decadal oscillation. The mean amplitude of the MJO is 16% larger in the postrupture (1976-2005) compared to the prerupture (1950-75) period. Before the 1975 rupture, the amplitude of the MJO is maximum (minimum) under El Ni{\~{n}}o (La Ni{\~{n}}a) conditions during northern winter, and minimum (maximum) under El Ni{\~{n}}o (La Ni{\~{n}}a) conditions during northern summer. After the rupture, this relationship disappears.

abstract = {In the 1960s, Jacob Bjerknes suggested that if the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) fluxes and the oceanic heat storage did not vary too much, then the total energy transport by the climate system would not vary too much either. This implies that any large anomalies of oceanic and atmospheric energy transport should be equal and opposite. This simple scenario has become known as Bjerknes compensation. A long control run of the Third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Model (HadCM3) has been investigated. It was found that northern extratropical decadal anomalies of atmospheric and oceanic energy transports are significantly anticorrelated and have similar magnitudes, which is consistent with the predictions of Bjerknes compensation. The degree of compensation in the northern extratropics was found to increase with increasing time scale. Bjerknes compensation did not occur in the Tropics, primarily as large changes in the surface fluxes were associated with large changes in the TOA fluxes. In the oce an, the decadal variability of the energy transport is associated with fluctuations in the meridional overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean. A stronger Atlantic Ocean energy transport leads to strong warming of surface temperatures in the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN) Seas, which results in a reduced equator-to-pole surface temperature gradient and reduced atmospheric baroclinicity. It is argued that a stronger Atlantic Ocean energy transport leads to a weakened atmospheric transient energy transport. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {A low-resolution coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (OAGCM) is used to study the characteristics of the large-scale ocean circulation and its climatic impacts in a series of global coupled aquaplanet experiments. Three configurations, designed to produce fundamentally different ocean circulation regimes, are considered. The first has no obstruction to zonal flow, the second contains a low barrier that blocks zonal flow in the ocean at all latitudes, creating a single enclosed basin, while the third contains a gap in the barrier to allow circumglobal flow at high southern latitudes. Warm greenhouse cli mates with a global average air surface temperature of around 27°C result in all cases. Equator-to-pole temperature gradients are shallower than that of a current climate simulation. While changes in the land configuration cause regional changes in temperature, winds, and rainfall, heat transports within the system are little affected. Inhibition of all ocean transport on the aquaplanet leads to a reduction in global mean surface temperature of 8°C, along with a sharpening of the meridional temperature gradient. This results from a reduction in global atmospheric water vapor content and an increase in tropical albedo, both of which act to reduce global surface temperatures. Fitting a simple radiative model to the atmospheric chara cteristics of the OAGCM solutions suggests that a simpler atmosphere model, with radiative parameters chosen a priori based on the changing surface configuration, would have produced qualitatively different results. This implies that studies with reduced complexity atmospheres need to be guided by more complex OAGCM results on a case-by-case basis. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The authors study the role of ocean heat transport (OHT) in the maintenance of a warm, equable, ice-free climate. An ensemble of idealized aquaplanetGCMcalculations is used to assess the equilibrium sensitivity of global mean surface temperature (T) and its equator-to-pole gradient ($\Delta$T) to variations in OHT, prescribed through a simple analytical formula representing export out of the tropics and poleward convergence. Lowlatitude OHT warms the mid- to high latitudes without cooling the tropics; T increases by 1°C and DT decreases by 2.6°C for every 0.5-PW increase in OHT across 30° latitude. This warming is relatively insensitive to the detailed meridional structure of OHT. It occurs in spite of near-perfect atmospheric compensation of large imposed variations in OHT: the total poleward heat transport is nearly fixed. The warming results from a convective adjustment of the extratropical troposphere. Increased OHT drives a shift from large-scale to convective precipitation in the midlatitude storm tracks. Warming arises primarily from enhanced greenhouse trapping associated with convective moistening of the upper troposphere. Warming extends to the poles by atmospheric processes even in the absence of high-latitude OHT. A new conceptual model for equable climates is proposed, in which OHT plays a key role by driving enhanced deep convection in the midlatitude storm tracks. In this view, the climatic impact of OHT depends on its effects on the greenhouse properties of the atmosphere, rather than its ability to increase the total poleward energy transport. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

The database is composed of 22 796 oxygen isotope values of phosphatic and calcareous fossils. The result shows two prolonged cooling events happened in the Late Paleozoic and Late Cenozoic, coinciding with two major ice ages indicated by continental glaciation data, and seven global warming events that happened in the Late Cambrian, Silurian-Devonian transition, Late Devonian, Early Triassic, Toarcian, Late Cretaceous, and Paleocene-Eocene transition. The SSTs during these warming periods are about 5–30 °C higher than the present-day level. Oxygen contents of shallow seawater are calculated from temperature, salinity, and atmospheric oxygen. The results show that major dissolved oxygen valleys of surface seawater coincide with global warming events and ocean anoxic events. We propose that the combined effect of temperature and dissolved oxygen account for the long-term evolution of global oceanic redox state during the Phanerozoic.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that increases in poleward ocean heat transport (OHT) do not strongly affect tropical SST. The goal of this paper is to explain this observation. To do so, the authors force two atmospheric global climate models (GCMs) in aquaplanet configuration with a variety of prescribed OHTs. It is found that increased OHT weakens the Hadley circulation, which decreases equatorial cloud cover and shortwave reflection, as well as reduces surface winds and evaporation, which both limit changes in tropical SST. The authors also modify one of the GCMs by alternatively setting the radiative effect of clouds to zero and disabling wind-driven evaporation changes to show that the cloud feedback is more important than the wind-evaporation feedback for maintaining constant equatorial SST as OHT changes. This work highlights the fact that OHT can reduce the meridional SST gradient without affecting tropical SST and could therefore serve as an additional degree of freedom for explaining past warm climates. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The coupled climate dynamics underlying large, rapid, and potentially irreversible changes in ice cover are studied.A global atmosphere-ocean-sea ice general circulation model with idealized aquaplanet geometry is forced by gradual multi-millennial variations in solar luminosity. The model traverses a hysteresis loop between warm ice-free conditions and cold glacial conditions in response to ±5 W m-2 variations in global, annual-mean insolation. Comparison of several model configurations confirms the importance of polar ocean processes in setting the sensitivity and time scales of the transitions. A "sawtooth"character is found with fasterwarming and slower cooling, reflecting the opposing effects of surface heating and cooling on upper-ocean buoyancy and, thus, effective heat capacity. The transition from a glacial to warm, equable climate occurs in about 200 years. In contrast to the "freshwater hosing"scenario, transitions are driven by radiative forcing and sea ice feedbacks. The ocean circulation, and notably the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), does not drive the climate change. The MOC (and associated heat transport) collapses poleward of the advancing ice edge, but this is a purely passive response to cooling and ice expansion. The MOC does, however, play a key role in setting the time scales of the transition and contributes to the asymmetry between warming and cooling. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Multiple equilibria in a coupled ocean-atmosphere-sea ice general circulation model (GCM) of an aquaplanet with many degrees of freedom are studied. Three different stable states are found for exactly the same set of parameters and external forcings: a cold state in which a polar sea ice cap extends into the midlatitudes; a warm state, which is ice free; and a completely sea ice-covered "snowball" state. Although low-order energy balance models of the climate are known to exhibit intransitivity (i.e., more than one climate state for a given set of governing equations), the results reported herfile:///Users/alexandrepohl/Desktop/2018GL077019.pdfe are the first to demonstrate that this is a property of a complex coupled climate model with a consistent set of equations representing the 3D dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. The coupled model notably includes atmospheric synoptic systems, large-scale circulation of the ocean, a fully active hydrological cycle, sea ice, and a seasonal cycle. There are no flux adjustments, with the system being solely forced by incoming solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere. It is demonstrated that the multiple equilibria owe their existence to the presence of meridional structure in ocean heat transport: namely, a large heat transport out of the tropics and a relatively weak high-latitude transport. The associated large midlatitude convergence of ocean heat transport leads to a preferred latitude at which the sea ice edge can rest. The mechanism operates in two very different ocean circulation regimes, suggesting that the stabilization of the large ice cap could be a robust feature of the climate system. Finally, the role of ocean heat convergence in permitting multiple equilibria is further explored in simpler models: an atmospheric GCM coupled to a slab mixed layer ocean and an energy balance model. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Climatic deterioration in northeastern Canada following the last interglacial resulted in the formation and abrupt expansion of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. However, the physical mechanisms leading to rapid ice sheet expansion are not well understood. Here, the authors report on experiments using an ice sheet model asynchronously coupled to a GCM to investigate the role of ice sheet-climate feedbacks in terminating the last interglacial period. In agreement with simpler models, the experiments indicate that a specific type of ice-albedo feedback, the small ice cap instability, is the dominant process controlling rapid expansion of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. As ice elevations increase in northeastern Canada, a stationary wave forms and strengthens over the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which acts to hinder further expansion of the ice margin and reduce the effect of the small ice cap instability. The sensitivity of these feedbacks to ice topography results in a reduction in simulated ice volume when the communication interval between the GCM and ice sheet model is lengthened since this permits larger gains in ice elevation between GCM updates and biases the simulation toward a stronger stationary wave feedback. The shortest communication interval (500 yr) leads to a Laurentide ice volume of 6 × 10 6 km 3 in 10 kyr, which is less than ice volume estimates based on the geological record but is a substantial improvement over previous GCM studies. The authors discuss potential improvements to the asynchronous coupling scheme that would more accurately resolve ice sheet-climate feedbacks, potentially leading to greater simulated ice volume. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {A series of coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice aquaplanet experiments is described in which topological constraints on ocean circulation are introduced to study the role of ocean circulation on the mean climate of the coupled system. It is imagined that the earth is completely covered by an ocean of uniform depth except for the presence or absence of narrow barriers that extend from the bottom of the ocean to the sea surface. The following four configurations are described: Aqua (no land), Ridge (one barrier extends from pole to pole), Drake (one barrier extends from the North Pole to 358S), and DDrake (two such barriers are set 908 apart and join at the North Pole, separating the ocean into a large basin and a small basin, connected to the south). On moving from Aqua to Ridge to Drake to DDrake, the energy transports in the equilibrium solutions become increasingly "realistic," culminating in DDrake, which has an uncanny resemblance to the present climate. Remarkably, the zonal-average climates of Drake and DDrake are strikingly similar, exhibiting almost identical heat and freshwater transports, and meridional overturning circulations. However, Drake and DDrake differ dramatically in their regional climates. The small and large basins of DDrake exhibit distinctive Atlantic-like and Pacific-like characteristics, respectively: the small basin is warmer, saltier, and denser at the surface than the large basin, and is the main site of deep water formation with a deep overturning circulation and strong northward ocean heat transport. A sensitivity experiment with DDrake demonstrates that the salinity contrast between the two basins, and hence the localization of deep convection, results from a deficit of precipitation, rather than an excess of evaporation, over the small basin. It is argued that the width of the small basin relative to the zonal fetch of atmospheric precipitation is the key to understanding this salinity contrast. Finally, it is argued that many gross features of the present climate are consequences of two topological asymmetries that have profound effects on ocean circulation: a meridional asymmetry (circumpolar flow in the Southern Hemisphere; blocked flow in the Northern Hemisphere) and a zonal asymmetry (a small basin and a large basin). {\textcopyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Proglacial areas receive fluxes of glacial meltwater in addition to their own hydrological inputs and outputs, while in high latitudes the seasonal development of the active layer also affects their hydrology. This paper supplements a previous study of the surface and atmospheric water fluxes in the proglacial area of the Svalbard glacier Finsterwalderbreen (77° N), by focusing on the sub-surface water fluxes of the active layer, and bringing together all the components of the proglacial water balance over a complete annual cycle. Particular attention is given to the transitional zone between the moraine complex and the flat sandur. Sub-surface water in the moraine complex (sourced mainly from snowmelt, lake drainage and active-layer thawing), is exchanged with sub-surface water from the sandur (sourced mainly from glacier-derived snow- and ice-melt), across a largely distinct boundary. Hydraulic head and specific discharge were monitored in a transect of wells spanning this boundary. A hydraulic gradient from the moraine complex to the sandur is maintained throughout the melt season, although this is reversed first briefly when glacial runoff floods the sandur, and then diurnally from mid-melt-season, as peak daily flow in the proglacial channel network drives sub-surface water in the sandur towards the moraine complex. It is estimated that the active layer does not freeze up until mid-December at this location, so that sub-surface water flow may be maintained for months after the cessation of surface runoff. However, the magnitude of sub-surface flow is very small: the total, annual flux from the moraine complex to the sandur is 11. mm, compared with 1073. mm of total, annual runoff from the whole catchment (glacier included). Furthermore, when considering the water balance of the entire proglacial area, there are unlikely to be significant, seasonal storage changes in the active layer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We used an isotope-equipped general circulation model to assess the influence of changing Eocene paleogeography and climate on paleoelevation estimates. Our simulations indicate that stable isotope paleoaltimetry methods are not applicable in Eocene Asia because of a combination of increased convective precipitation, mixture of air masses, and widespread aridity. Rather, a model-data comparison suggests that the Tibetan Plateau only reached low to moderate (less than 3000 meters) elevations during the Eocene, reconciling oxygen isotope data with other proxies.},

Because the ocean contains a much wider range of time scales the same procedure is not practical for ocean general circulation models.

For the parameter range in which equilibrium solutions exist, a method based on distorted physics partially circumvents this difficulty. The distorted physics compresses the frequency band of the ocean model by slowing down gravity waves and speeding up abyssal processes. The acceleration of abyssal processes is accomplished by decreasing the local heat capacity without altering the transport and mixing of heat.

In the case of westward winds it is of paramount importance that the nonzero heat flux into the ocean be taken into account. This heat flux stabilizes the upper layers and reduces the intensity of the mixing, especially in the east.

Our model system includes a global Earth System Model (IPSL-CM5A-LR), the biogeochemical model PISCES and the ecosystem model APECOSM that simulates upper trophic level organisms using a size-based approach and three interactive pelagic communities (epipelagic, migratory and mesopelagic). Analyzing an idealized (e.g., no anthropogenic forcing) 300-yr long pre-industrial simulation, we find that low and high frequency variability is dominant for the large and small organisms, respectively. Our model shows that the size-range exhibiting the largest variability at a given frequency, defined as the resonant range, also depends on the community. At a given frequency, the resonant range of the epipelagic community includes larger organisms than that of the migratory community and similarly, the latter includes larger organisms than the resonant range of the mesopelagic community. This study shows that the simulated temporal variability of marine pelagic organisms' abundance is not only influenced by natural climate fluctuations but also by the structure of the pelagic community. As a consequence, the size- and community-dependent response of marine ecosystems to climate variability could impact the sustainability of fisheries in a warming world.},

abstract = {We present coupled ocean–sea-ice simulations of the Middle Jurassic (∼165 Ma) when Laurasia and Gondwana began drifting apart and gave rise to the formation of the Atlantic Ocean. Since the opening of the Proto-Caribbean is not well constrained by geological records, configurations with and without an open connection between the Proto-Caribbean and Panthalassa are examined. We use a sea-floor bathymetry obtained by a recently developed three-dimensional (3D) elevation model which compiles geological, palaeogeographical and geophysical data. Our original approach consists in coupling this elevation model, which is based on detailed reconstructions of oceanic realms, with a dynamical ocean circulation model. We find that the Middle Jurassic bathymetry of the Central Atlantic and Proto-Caribbean seaway only allows for a weak current of the order of 2 Sv in the upper 1000 m even if the system is open to the west. The effect of closing the western boundary of the Proto-Caribbean is to increase the transport related to barotropic gyres in the southern hemisphere and to change water properties, such as salinity, in the Neo-Tethys. Weak upwelling rates are found in the nascent Atlantic Ocean in the presence of this superficial current and we discuss their compatibility with deep-sea sedimentological records in this region.},

abstract = {Numerical experiments are described that pertain to the climate of a coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice system in the absence of land, driven by modern-day orbital and CO2 forcing. Millennial time-scale simulations yield a mean state in which ice caps reach down to 55° of latitude and both the atmosphere and ocean comprise eastward- and westward-flowing zonal jets, whose structure is set by their respective baroclinic instabilities. Despite the zonality of the ocean, it is remarkably efficient at transporting heat meridionally through the agency of Ekman transport and eddy-driven subduction. Indeed the partition of heat transport between the atmosphere and ocean is much the same as the present climate, with the ocean dominating in the Tropics and the atmosphere in the mid-high latitudes. Variability of the system is dominated by the coupling of annular modes in the atmosphere and ocean. Stochastic variability inherent to the atmospheric jets drives variability in the ocean. Zonal flows in the ocean exhibit decadal variability, which, remarkably, feeds back to the atmosphere, coloring the spectrum of annular variability. A simple stochastic model can capture the essence of the process. Finally, it is briefly reviewed how the aquaplanet can provide information about the processes that set the partition of heat transport and the climate of Earth. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {A model for oceanic cycles is presented. The cycles are expressed as changes between more humid low latitude and cooler high latitude climates (P episodes), and dryer low latitude and warmer high latitude climates (S episodes). The cyclicity may be self-regulating through changes in the CO2 storage capacity of the deep ocean due to temperature changes and through changes in the oceanic input and output of dissolved carbonate. The model permits over 30 predictions regarding observable changes in both deep water and shelf lithologies and variations in the abundance, diversity and extinction rate of planktic and benthic faunas. Sedimentary changes involve fluctuations in the rate of clay deposition and carbonate production, the advance and retreat of carbonate deposition on the shelf edge, the timing of oolite, reef, and black shale formation, and changes between oxic and anoxic deep water. Faunal effects include both iterative evolution and intermittently widespread taxa ('Lazarus taxa'). These predictions agree well with changes observed in well known sequence of Wenlock and Ludlow age, as well as changes seen in selected older and younger sequences.},

These new models support multiple stable ice edges not found in the classical EBM and a hysteresis loop capable of generating abrupt warming as the ice edge "jumps" from midto high latitudes. The new equilibria are demonstrated in two classes of model, in which the wind stress is either specified externally or generated interactively. Wind stress is computed by introducing a dynamical constraint into the EBM to represent the simultaneous meridional transport of energy and angular momentum in the atmosphere. This wind stress is used to drive ocean gyres, with associated structure in their meridional heat transport, so that the atmosphere and ocean are coupled together both thermally and mechanically. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Between $\sim$750 and 635 million years ago, during the Neoproterozoic era, the earth experienced at least two significant, possibly global, glaciations, termed "Snowball Earth." While many studies have focused on the dynamics and the role of the atmosphere and ice flow over the ocean in these events, only a few have investigated the related associated ocean circulation, and no study has examined the ocean circulation under a thick ($\sim$1 km deep) sea ice cover, driven by geothermal heat flux. Here, a thick sea ice-flow model coupled to an ocean general circulation model is used to study the ocean circulation under Snowball Earth conditions. The ocean circulation is first investigated under a simplified zonal symmetry assumption, and (i) strong equatorial zonal jets and (ii) a strong meridional overturning cell are found, limited to an area very close to the equator. The authors derive an analytic approximation for the latitude-depth ocean dynamics and find that the extent of the meridional overturning circulation cell only depends on the horizontal eddy viscosity and {\ss} (the change of the Coriolis parameter with latitude). The analytic approximation closely reproduces the numerical results. Three-dimensional ocean simulations, with reconstructed Neoproterozoic continental configuration, confirm the zonally symmetric dynamics and show additional boundary currents and strong upwelling and downwelling near the continents. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

Both taphonomic and paleoecologic data indicate a lack of transport reflecting the original community. The assemblage is closely comparable to the widespread latest Ordovician Hirnantia-Dalmanitina fauna. The Hirnantian age of the Zapla diamictite is further corroborated by the record of the northern Gondwana chitinozoans Spinachitina cf. oulebsiri Paris and Desmochitina minor typica Eisenack. The graptolites and chitinozoans from the overlying Lipe{\'{o}}n Formation indicate that the postglacial transgression took place in the earliest Llandovery (Parakidograptus acuminatus Biozone). According to the tectonosedimentary evidence, the Early Silurian age of the Canca{\~{n}}iri and San Gab{\'{a}}n diamictites of north-central Bolivia and south Peru based on their palynological record is more likely the age of posglacial gravity flows and not that of the glaciation. We support the hypothesis that the weakly lithified glacigenic deposits of Hirnantian age were reworked and redistributed by high-energy marine processes during the postglacial transgression and then transported to the adjacent deep-marine trough. Iron-rich horizons have been recognized in many basins of southern South America reflecting eustatic and paleoclimatic fluctuations. Most of them formed during the early stages of the postglacial transgression at the Ordovician/Silurian transition and are associated with low sedimentation rates and condensed intervals. The mild maritime postglacial climate, the increasing atmospheric CO 2 , and possibly the presence of incipient vegetated areas led to extensive weathering of glacigenic sediments supplying iron into the marine system to form ferruginous deposits. The sea level fall related to the peak of glaciation is recorded by both paleovalley incision and a sharp subaerial to subglacial unconformity. The transgressive systems tract starts with fluvio-estuarine deposits within incised valleys followed by widespread deposition of subtidal to open marine organic-rich shales onlapping regionally the basement rocks. The recognition of key stratigraphic markers (e.g. sequence boundary, flooding surface, ferruginous beds), alongside reliable micro and macropaleontological evidence allow a more accurate correlation between the Central Andean Basin of Peru, Bolivia and NW Argentina, the W Puna region, the Paraguayan and Brazilian sectors of the Paran{\'{a}} Basin, the Precordillera Basin of W Argentina, and the Cape Basin of South Africa.},

abstract = {The reconstruction of past variations in seawater strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) from marine carbonate skeletons (MCSs) is based on the assumption that the Sr isotope composition of oceans is homogeneous worldwide. However, fossil materials are mainly from shelf domains whose modern Sr budget is known to be very sensitive to continental Sr fluxes. Their reliability as chemostratigraphic tools or weathering proxies may thus be questioned, especially because no formal appraisal of biological and environmental biases has been done on a global scale. Here, we provide new modern MCS 87Sr/86Sr values from various marine environments that we analyze statistically in regards to extensive compilations of MCS and water data. We show that most MCS 87Sr/86Sr values fall within the range of those of modern oceanic waters (0.709172 ± 23). Others, concerning $\sim$30% of studied localities, may display slight to considerable offsets compared to the 87Sr/86Sr signature of modern seawater (±250 × 10-6). These patterns mainly concern bivalves and gastropods, or more generally epibenthic and eurytopic organisms, from coastal domains with water mass restriction, low salinity, or strong continental supplies (fjords, lagoons, endorheic basins). Beyond classical fluvial freshwater influences, submarine groundwater discharges may lead to a less radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr signature of MCSs even in lagoons with euhaline conditions (e.g., Oualidia lagoon, Morocco). All biases considered, this calls for caution in relative dating, as we calculate that half the values of the Phanerozoic 87Sr/86Sr curve cannot provide time calibration accuracy better than ±3 m.y., which is necessary to discriminate the shorter stages.},

abstract = {This paper formulates tracer stirring arising from the Gent-McWilliams (GM) eddy-induced transport in terms of a skew-diffusive flux. A skew-diffusive tracer flux is directed normal to the tracer gradient, which is in contrast to a diffusive tracer flux directed down the tracer gradient. Analysis of the GM skew flux provides an understanding of the physical mechanisms prescribed by GM stirring, which is complementary to the more familiar advective flux perspective. Additionally, it unifies the tracer mixing operators arising from Redi isoneutral diffusion and GM stirring. This perspective allows for a computationally efficient and simple manner in which to implement the GM closure in z-coordinate models. With this approach, no more computation is necessary than when using isoneutral diffusion alone. Additionally, the numerical realization of the skew flux is significantly smoother than the advective flux. The reason is that to compute the skew flux, no gradient of the diffusivity or isoneutral slope is taken, whereas such a gradient is needed for computing the advective flux. The skew-flux formulation also exposes a striking cancellation of terms that results when the GM diffusion coefficient is identical to the Redi isoneutral diffusion coefficient. For this case, the horizontal components to the tracer flux are aligned down the horizontal tracer gradient, and the resulting computational cost of Redi diffusion plus GM skew diffusion is roughly half that needed for Redi diffusion alone.},

Conversely, the triggers of four other Phanerozoic mass extinction intervals have decisively been linked to LIPs, owing to documented mercury anomalies, shown as the diagnostic proxy. Here, we report multiple Hg enrichments in the two-step late Frasnian (Kellwasser) crisis interval from paleogeographically distant successions in Morocco, Germany, and northern Russia. The distinguishing signal, > 1 ppm Hg in the domain of closing Rheic Ocean, was identified in different lithologies immediately below the F-F boundary and approximately correlated with the onset of the main extinction pulse. This key Hg anomaly, comparable only with an extreme spike known from the end-Ordovician extinction, was not controlled by increased bioproductivity in an anoxic setting. We suggest, therefore, that the global chemostratigraphic pattern near the F-F boundary records a greatly increased worldwide Hg input, controlled by the Center Hill eruptive pulse of the Eovariscan volcanic acme, but likely not manifested exclusively by LIP(s). Consequently, all five major biotic crises of the Phanerozoic have now been more reliably linked to volcanic cataclysms.},

These data indicate that global continental arc systems were spatially reduced at the onset of the Cryogenian glacial interval, widespread during the Cambrian greenhouse, and reduced during Ordovician cooling. The Cambrian greenhouse was coincident with ecologically stressed conditions, whereas Ordovician global cooling was accompanied by a major biodiversifi cation event.

Here we show congruence between temperature indicators and climate model output for the cool greenhouse interval of the latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) using a global database of terrestrial and marine indicators and fully coupled simulations with the Community Climate System Model version 3. In these simulations we explore potential roles of greenhouse gases and properties of pre-anthropogenic liquid clouds in creating warm conditions. Our model simulations successfully reproduce warm polar temperatures and the latitudinal temperature gradient without overheating the tropics. Best fits for mean annual temperature are simulations that use 6× preindustrial levels of atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf>, or 2× preindustrial levels of atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> and liquid cloud properties that may reflect pre-anthropogenic levels of cloud condensation nuclei. The Siberian interior is problematic, but this may relate to reconstructed elevation and the presence of lakes. Data and models together indicate tropical sea-surface temperatures $\sim$5 °C above modern, an equator-to-pole temperature difference of 25-30 °C, and a mid-latitudinal temperature gradient of $\sim$0.4 °C per 1° latitude, similar to the Eocene. Modified liquid cloud properties allow successful simulation of Maastrichtian climate at the relatively low levels of atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> indicated by proxies and carbon cycle modeling. This supports the suggestion that altered properties of liquid clouds may be an important mechanism of warming during past greenhouse intervals.},

abstract = {Changes in ocean circulation have been proposed as a trigger mechanism for the large coupled climate and carbon cycle perturbations at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ca. 55 Ma). An abrupt warming of oceanic intermediate waters could have initiated the thermal destabilization of sediment-hosted methane gas hydrates and potentially triggered sediment slumps and slides. In an ensemble of fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) simulations of the late Paleocene and early Eocene, we identify such a circulation-driven enhanced intermediate-water warming. Critically, we find an approximate twofold amplification of Atlantic intermediate-water warming when CO2 levels are doubled from 2× to 4× preindustrial CO2 compared to when they are doubled from 1× to 2×. This warming is largely focused on the equatorial and South Atlantic and is driven by a significant reduction in deep-water formation from the Southern Ocean. This scenario is consistent with altered PETM circulation patterns inferred from benthic carbon isotope data and the intensity of deep-sea carbonate dissolution in the South Atlantic. The linkage between intermediate-water warming and gas hydrate destabilization could provide an important feedback in the establishment of peak PETM warmth. {\textcopyright} 2010 Geological Society of America.},

Our data show that the CIA values of sediments commonly range from 75 to 90 in the Wufeng and Longmaxi Formations, indicating a high degree of chemical weathering and thus a hot and humid climate during deposition. In contrast, a sharp drop in CIA values (most 60-70) in the Guanyinqiao Formation (or Hirnantian) suggests an overall cold and arid climate, interrupted by several intervals of warm climate when deposited.

abstract = {Normalization to a constant salinity (S) is widely used for the adjustment of marine inorganic carbon chemistry data such as total alkalinity (AT) and total dissolved inorganic carbon (CT). This procedure traces back to the earliest studies in marine chemistry, but ignores the influence of riverine input of alkalinity and of dissolution of biogenic carbonates in the ocean. We tested different adjustment possibilities for AT and conclude that in most parts of the surface ocean the normalization concept does not reflect relationships which represent reality. In this paper, we propose a salinity adjustment based on a constant and region-specific term for S = O, which expresses river run off, upwelling from below the lysocline, calcification, and lateral sea surface water exchange. One application of the normalization concept is its extension to AT and also CT predictions and implementation in models. We give a brief discussion on the usage of such extensions.},

The deposition of organic-rich sediments on the margins of the equatorial region is found to be consistent with the patterns of upwelling in simulations which incorporate only a shallow (≤ 300m) equatorial connection between the North and South Atlantic. Fracture zone ridges were probably responsible for the effective shallowness of the gateway.

abstract = {SUMMARY: The rapid melting of the Earth's ice reservoirs will produce geographically distinct patterns of sea level change that have come to be known as sea level fingerprints. A basic, gravitationally self-consistent theory for computing these patterns appeared in the 1970s; however, recent, highly discrepant fingerprint calculations have led to suggestions that the algorithms and/or theoretical implementation adopted in many previous predictions is not robust. We present a suite of numerical predictions, including benchmark comparisons with analytic results, that counter this argument and demonstrate the accuracy of most published predictions. Moreover, we show that small differences apparent in calculations published by some groups can be accounted for by subtle differences in the underlying physics. The paper concludes with two sensitivity analyses: (1) we present the first-ever calculation of sea level fingerprints on earth models with 3-D variations in elastic structure and density, and conclude that this added complexity has a negligible effect on the predictions; (2) we compare fingerprints of polar ice sheet mass flux computed under the (very common) assumption of a uniform melt distribution to fingerprints calculated using melt geometries constrained by analysing recent trends in GRACE gravity data. Predictions in the near field of the ice sheets are sensitive to the assumed melt geometry; however, this sensitivity also extends to the far field, particularly in the case of Antarctic mass changes, because of the strong dependence of the rotational feedback signal on the melt geometry. We conclude that inferences of ice sheet mass flux based on modern sea level constraints should consider these more realistic melt geometries. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

This paper documents the sediment-flow processes associated with the resedimentation of an ice-cored lateral moraine at Kongsvegen, Svalbard. Decay of the ice-cored lateral moraine is dominated by the development of a sediment-flow fan, which has an 'hour-glass' form in plan. The fan comprises a broad source area on the crest of the lateral moraine separated from the fan surface, composed of tessellated flow lobes, by a narrow ice-floored channel system. The principle sedimentary facies associated with this fan include matrix-supported diamictons, laminated silts and fine sands. The evolution of this fan and the likely end-products after complete deglaciation are discussed, and this paper contributes modern analogue data relevant to the intepretation of the Pleistocene landform and sediment record.

abstract = {We describe how the existing sea-level equation incorrectly predicts the change in sea level (and thus the ocean load) in ice-covered, subgeoidal geographic regions during periods of deglaciation. We go on to present a new sea-level equation that overcomes this problem and we describe how this equation can be solved in a gravitationally self-consistent manner by employing a well-known spectral technique. Application of the new theory to predict relative sea-level (rsl) histories and present-day, 3-D, solid surface deformation rates in northeastern Canada (based on a single earth model characterized by a lithospheric thickness of 100 km and upper and lower mantle viscosities of 5 x 1020 and 5 x 1021 Pa s, respectively) demonstrates that a significant error is introduced when the original theory is employed to predict the oceanic component of the surface load. Predictions of rsl curves show a discrepancy of $\sim$40 per cent at sites where data have been obtained and employed to constrain models of earth viscosity structure and ice-sheet histories. This error will significantly bias estimates of mantle viscosity structure and ice thicknesses that are based on the original theory. In addition, predictions of 3-D deformation rates differ by up to 25 per cent in some regions and so future applications that employ these data to constrain models of the glacial isostatic adjustment process should adopt the improved sea-level theory. In contrast, estimates of inverse decay times from the predicted rsl curves are insensitive (to within the observational error) to the improvement in the surface load introduced by the new theory. Thus, viscosity structure inferences based on this parametrization and the original sea-level equation are unaffected by the error in the ocean load. Finally, the new theory predicts a eustatic (i.e. globally uniform) rise in sea level over the postglacial period that is $\sim$11 m lower than that determined via the original theory. Therefore, estimates of the global ice budget at the last glacial maximum based on far-field rsl data and the original sea-level theory will be too small by $\sim$10 per cent.},

abstract = {Abstract Global sea-level has changed in a cyclic manner through geologic history, but the regularities of these changes are yet to be fully understood. Despite certain (and sometimes significant) differences, the available Mesozoic eustatic curves permit the outlining of long-term eustatic cycles, which are provisionally defined as cycles recognizable at the stage level and higher. Interpretation of the Triassic eustatic curves indicates two orders of long-term cycles and a 1st-order sea-level rise throughout the entire period. The Jurassic eustatic curves imply cyclicity of one or two orders, and a 1st-order eustatic rise during the entire period is also evident. Most challenges are interpretations for the Cretaceous; two to four orders of long-term eustatic cycles can be established for this period. Generally, the hierarchy of the long-term eustatic cycles might have changed through the Mesozoic. If so, and if one considers differences of cycles of the same order between the periods of this era, it is difficult to apply "standard" hierarchical classifications to the documented cycles. The hypothetical uncertainty of the hierarchy of the Mesozoic long-term eustatic cycles is an important challenge for modern researchers.},

abstract = {As the chronicle of plate motions through time, paleogeography is fundamental to our understanding of plate tectonics and its role in shaping the geology of the present-day. To properly appreciate the history of tectonics - and its influence on the deep Earth and climate - it is imperative to seek an accurate and global model of paleogeography. However, owing to the incessant loss of oceanic lithosphere through subduction, the paleogeographic reconstruction of 'full-plates' (including oceanic lithosphere) becomes increasingly challenging with age. Prior to 150 Ma ∼60% of the lithosphere is missing and reconstructions are developed without explicit regard for oceanic lithosphere or plate tectonic principles; in effect, reflecting the earlier mobilistic paradigm of continental drift. Although these 'continental' reconstructions have been immensely useful, the next-generation of mantle models requires global plate kinematic descriptions with full-plate reconstructions. Moreover, in disregarding (or only loosely applying) plate tectonic rules, continental reconstructions fail to take advantage of a wealth of additional information in the form of practical constraints. Following a series of new developments, both in geodynamic theory and analytical tools, it is now feasible to construct full-plate models that lend themselves to testing by the wider Earth-science community. Such a model is presented here for the late Paleozoic (410-250 Ma) together with a review of the underlying data. Although we expect this model to be particularly useful for numerical mantle modeling, we hope that it will also serve as a general framework for understanding late Paleozoic tectonics, one on which future improvements can be built and further tested. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Phytoplankton C:N stoichiometry is highly flexible due to physiological plasticity, which could lead to high variations in carbon fixation efficiency (carbon consumption relative to nitrogen). However, the magnitude, as well as the spatial and temporal scales of variability, remains poorly constrained. We used a high-resolution biogeochemical model resolving various scales from small to high, spatially and temporally, in order to quantify and better understand this variability. We find that phytoplankton C:N ratio is highly variable at all spatial and temporal scales (5-12 molC/molN), from mesoscale to regional scale, and is mainly driven by nitrogen supply. Carbon fixation efficiency varies accordingly at all scales (±30%), with higher values under oligotrophic conditions and lower values under eutrophic conditions. Hence, phytoplankton plasticity may act as a buffer by attenuating carbon sequestration variability. Our results have implications for in situ estimations of C:N ratios and for future predictions under high CO2 world.

These experiments are compared with uncoupled (i.e., mixed-layer) model experiments to determine the impact of a dynamical ocean on the Neoproterozoic simulations. In contrast to global sea-ice coverage in the uncoupled experiments, the sea-ice margin seasonally advances to 46 and 55° latitude in the coupled experiments. The coupled simulations demonstrate that dynamic ocean processes can prevent a snowball solution and suggest that a reduced solar luminosity and low atmospheric CO2 are not by themselves sufficient conditions for a snowball solution.

However, this result overlooks the important role of the non-CO<inf>2</inf> greenhouse gases and aerosols. This paper shows that global energetics require an immediate and significant warming following the cessation of emissions as aerosols are quickly washed from the atmosphere, and the large uncertainty in current aerosol radiative forcing implies a large uncertainty in the climate commitment. Fundamental constraints preclude Earth returning to pre-industrial temperatures for the indefinite future. These same constraints mean that observations are currently unable to eliminate the possibility that we are already beyond the point where the ultimate warming will exceed dangerous levels.

We have generated a large ensemble of paired runs (∼100) for pre-industrial and LGM boundary conditions with different versions of the same climate model of intermediate complexity. The model ensemble covers a broad range of climate sensitivities and produces a similarly broad range of dT LGM (4.3-9.8°C). Using reconstructed tropical SST cooling, we constrain the range of dTLGM to 5.8 ± 1.4°C, which is corroborated by proxy data from other regions. This cooling is considerably larger than most estimates of previous LGM simulations. The reason is that most models did not account for the effect of atmospheric dust content and vegetation changes, which yield an additional 1.0-1.7°C global cooling.

abstract = {PISCES-v2 (Pelagic Interactions Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies volume 2) is a biogeochemical model which simulates the lower trophic levels of marine ecosystems (phytoplankton, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and of the main nutrients (P, N, Fe, and Si). The model is intended to be used for both regional and global configurations at high or low spatial resolutions as well as for short-term (seasonal, interannual) and long-term (climate change, paleoceanography) analyses. There are 24 prognostic variables (tracers) including two phytoplankton compartments (diatoms and nanophytoplankton), two zooplankton size classes (microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and a description of the carbonate chemistry. Formulations in PISCES-v2 are based on a mixed Monod-quota formalism. On the one hand, stoichiometry of C / N / P is fixed and growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the external availability in N, P and Si. On the other hand, the iron and silicon quotas are variable and the growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the internal availability in Fe. Various parameterizations can be activated in PISCES-v2, setting, for instance, the complexity of iron chemistry or the description of particulate organic materials. So far, PISCES-v2 has been coupled to the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) and Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) systems. A full description of PISCES-v2 and of its optional functionalities is provided here. The results of a quasi-steady-state simulation are presented and evaluated against diverse observational and satellite-derived data. Finally, some of the new functionalities of PISCES-v2 are tested in a series of sensitivity experiments.},

The base currency in this model was nitrogen from which fluxes of organic carbon, including export to the deep ocean, were calculated by invoking fixed C:N ratios in phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus. However, due to anthropogenic activity, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has significantly increased above its natural, inter-glacial background. As such, simulating and predicting the carbon cycle in the ocean in its entirety, including ventilation of CO2 with the atmosphere and the resulting impact of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems, requires that both organic and inorganic carbon be afforded a more complete representation in the model specification. Here, we introduce MEDUSA-2.0, an expanded successor model which includes additional state variables for dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen and detritus carbon (permitting variable C:N in exported organic matter), as well as a simple benthic formulation and extended parameterizations of phytoplankton growth, calcification and detritus remineralisation. A full description of MEDUSA-2.0, including its additional functionality, is provided and a multi-decadal spin-up simulation (1860-2005) is performed. The biogeochemical performance of the model is evaluated using a diverse range of observational data, and MEDUSA-2.0 is assessed relative to comparable models using output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

The CMIP5/PMIP3 data sets were created from reconstructions made by three different groups, which were all obtained using a model-inversion approach but differ in the assumptions used in the modelling and in the type of data used as constraints. The ice-sheet extent in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) does not vary substantially between the three individual data sources. The difference in the topography of the NH ice sheets is also moderate, and smaller than the differences between these reconstructions (and the resultant composite reconstruction) and ice-sheet reconstructions used in previous generations of PMIP. Only two of the individual reconstructions provide information for Antarctica. The discrepancy between these two reconstructions is larger than the difference for the NH ice sheets, although still less than the difference between the composite reconstruction and previous PMIP ice-sheet reconstructions. Although largely confined to the ice-covered regions, differences between the climate response to the individual LGM reconstructions extend over the North Atlantic Ocean and Northern Hemisphere continents, partly through atmospheric stationary waves. Differences between the climate response to the CMIP5/PMIP3 composite and any individual ice-sheet reconstruction are smaller than those between the CMIP5/PMIP3 composite and the ice sheet used in the last phase of PMIP (PMIP2).},

The ocean model is also coupled to a fully formulated, vertically resolved diagenetic model. GEOCLIM reloaded is thus a unique tool to investigate the short- and long-term feedbacks between climatic conditions, continental inputs, ocean biogeochemical dynamics and diagenesis.

Tropical glaciers as those on Popocat{\'{e}}petl volcano can be affected also by the same processes but are more vulnerable because of their size and eruptive processes. Even though their extinction might not have a global impact, their disappearance deprives us of important climatic "gauges" at the ∼ 20° north latitude and impacts strongly the local environment. This is an account of the eruption-forced extinction of the glaciers of Popocat{\'{e}}petl volcano. We show that 40% of climatic-related shrinkage occurred in 4 decades whereas 32% of eruption-related shrinkage occurred in 4 yr. Long-term effects of glacier extinction include an imbalance between recharge and extraction of groundwater at surrounding aquifers provoked by the disappearance of glacier-related melt water. Events like this may occur at other tropical glaciers worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

timing of the terrestrialization of plants remains debated and previous data indicate Gondwana to be the
center of land-plant radiation at $\sim$ 470–460 Ma. Here we present the oldest occurrences of trilete spores,
probably the earliest traces of vascular land plants yet recorded. The spores occur in Ordovician, Sandbian
(455 million years old) successions in central Sweden, once part of the paleocontinent Baltica. These strata
are independently dated by marine microfossils (conodonts) and 206Pb/238U dating of volcanic ash deposits.
Our discovery extends the record of trilete spores globally by $\sim$8 million years, and for Baltica by $\sim$25 million
years. Additionally, cryptospore assemblages are identified revealing a diverse and stable mid-Ordovician
(Darriwilian: $\sim$ 460 Ma) vegetation of free-sporing plants. The formation of regolith substrates on land as
a consequence of permanent plant cover must in turn have affected the marine biota. We link these early
land plant spore occurrences to the extensive, nutrient-rich volcanic ash deposits and propose Baltica as the
possible original region of the radiation of early land plants.},

Five major highstands and one minor highstand fit the Lower Silurian (Llandovery and Wenlock series). Three major highstands fit the Upper Silurian (Ludlow and Př{\'{i}}dol{\'{i}} series). Three separate episodes of glaciation correspond to drops in sea level from the Lower Silurian but fluctuations recorded in the Upper Silurian have no clear cause. Many oceanic events share common trends when the relationship with sea-level fluctuations is tested against a tight biostratigraphic framework. The Sandvika Event correlates with a sea-level drop between the second and third highstands from the Llandovery Series. An unnamed secundo-primo event overlaps the fall between the third and fourth highstands. The Ireviken Event corresponds to a drop near the basal Wenlock. The Boge Event matches a minor draw down superimposed on the fifth rise from the Sheinwoodian Stage. The Mulde Event partly fits a drop in the Lower Homerian Stage. The Linde Event corresponds to the low between the sixth and seventh peaks from the Ludlow Series and the Klev Event fits the lowstand between the seventh and eighth peaks near the Ludlow-Pfř{\'{i}}dol{\'{i}} boundary. The Lau Event, however, appears to adjoin the seventh highstand.

abstract = {A biogeochemical general circulation model which includes production and consumption processes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is developed. The semilabile and the refractory DOM are taken into account. The vertical distribution of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and the $\Delta$14C value obtained in our model compares well with the recent observations. It is found that the double DOC maximum zone (DDMZ) extends in the east-west direction in the equatorial Pacific. Case studies, which change the decay time and production ratio constant, show that the horizontal distribution of DOC in the surface layer can be reproduced only when the decay time of the semilabile DOM is about half a year. The semilabile DOM exists only above a depth of 400 m, and its vertical and horizontal transport plays an important role in the marine biogeochemical cycle in the surface layer. However, below that depth, only the inert refractory DOM exists, and the role of the refractory DOM in the biogeochemical cycle is not important. The global export production due to the particulate organic matter (POM) and DOM at a depth of 100 m is estimated to be about 8 Gt C/yr and about 3 Gt C/yr, respectively. The vertical transport below 400 m is due almost entirely to POM. Copyright 1997 by the American Geophysical Union.},

@article{DeConto2003,
abstract = {The sudden, widespread glaciation of Antarctica and the associated shift towards colder temperatures at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (approximately 34 million years ago) (refs 1-4) is one of the most fundamental reorganizations of global climate known in the geologic record. The glaciation of Antarctica has hitherto been thought to result from the tectonic opening of Southern Ocean gateways, which enabled the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the subsequent thermal isolation of the Antarctic continent. Here we simulate the glacial inception and early growth of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet using a general circulation model with coupled components for atmosphere, ocean, ice sheet and sediment, and which incorporates palaeogeography, greenhouse gas, changing orbital parameters, and varying ocean heat transport. In our model, declining Cenozoic CO2 first leads to the formation of small, highly dynamic ice caps on high Antarctic plateaux. At a later time, a CO2 threshold is crossed, initiating ice-sheet height/mass-balance feedbacks that cause the ice caps to expand rapidly with large orbital variations, eventually coalescing into a continental-scale East Antarctic Ice Sheet. According to our simulation the opening of Southern Ocean gateways plays a secondary role in this transition, relative to CO2 concentration.},

@article{Qiu2006,
abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among the four major lineages of land plants (liverworts, mosses, hornworts, and vascular plants) remain vigorously contested; their resolution is essential to our understanding of the origin and early evolution of land plants. We analyzed three different complementary data sets: a multigene supermatrix, a genomic structural character matrix, and a chloroplast genome sequence matrix, using maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and compatibility methods. Analyses of all three data sets strongly supported liverworts as the sister to all other land plants, and analyses of the multigene and chloroplast genome matrices provided moderate to strong support for hornworts as the sister to vascular plants. These results highlight the important roles of liverworts and hornworts in two major events of plant evolution: the water-to-land transition and the change from a haploid gametophyte generation-dominant life cycle in bryophytes to a diploid sporophyte generation-dominant life cycle in vascular plants. This study also demonstrates the importance of using a multifaceted approach to resolve difficult nodes in the tree of life. In particular, it is shown here that densely sampled taxon trees built with multiple genes provide an indispensable test of taxon-sparse trees inferred from genome sequences.},

@article{Porada2016,
abstract = {It has been hypothesized that predecessors of today's bryophytes significantly increased global chemical weathering in the Late Ordovician, thus reducing atmospheric CO2 concentration and contributing to climate cooling and an interval of glaciations. Studies that try to quantify the enhancement of weathering by non-vascular vegetation, however, are usually limited to small areas and low numbers of species, which hampers extrapolating to the global scale and to past climatic conditions. Here we present a spatially explicit modelling approach to simulate global weathering by non-vascular vegetation in the Late Ordovician. We estimate a potential global weathering flux of 2.8 (km(3) rock) yr(-1), defined here as volume of primary minerals affected by chemical transformation. This is around three times larger than today's global chemical weathering flux. Moreover, we find that simulated weathering is highly sensitive to atmospheric CO2 concentration. This implies a strong negative feedback between weathering by non-vascular vegetation and Ordovician climate.},

@article{Amiot2011,
abstract = {Early Cretaceous vertebrate assemblages from East Asia and particularly the Jehol Biota of northeastern China flourished during a period of highly debated climatic history. While the unique characters of these continental faunas have been the subject of various speculations about their biogeographic history, little attention has been paid to their possible climatic causes. Here we address this question using the oxygen isotope composition of apatite phosphate ($\delta$ ) from various reptile remains recovered from China, Thailand, and Japan. $\delta$ values indicate that cold terrestrial climates prevailed at least in this part of Asia during the Barremian-early Albian interval. Estimated mean air temperatures of about 10 ± 4 °C at midlatitudes (∼ 42 °N) correspond to present day cool temperate climatic conditions. Such low temperatures are in agreement with previous reports of cold marine temperatures during this part of the Early Cretaceous, as well as with the widespread occurrence of the temperate fossil wood genus Xenoxylon and the absence of thermophilic reptiles such as crocodilians in northeastern China. The unique character of the Jehol Biota is thus not only the result of its evolutionary and biogeographical history but is also due to rather cold local climatic conditions linked to the paleolatitudinal position of northeastern China and global icehouse climates that prevailed during this part of the Early Cretaceous.},

@article{Gasson2016,
abstract = {Geological data indicate that there were major variations in Antarctic ice sheet volume and extent during the early to mid-Miocene. Simulating such large-scale changes is problematic because of a strong hysteresis effect, which results in stability once the ice sheets have reached continental size. A relatively narrow range of atmospheric CO2 concentrations indicated by proxy records exacerbates this problem. Here, we are able to simulate large-scale variability of the early to mid-Miocene Antarctic ice sheet because of three developments in our modeling approach. (i) We use a climate-ice sheet coupling method utilizing a high-resolution atmospheric component to account for ice sheet-climate feedbacks. (ii) The ice sheet model includes recently proposed mechanisms for retreat into deep subglacial basins caused by ice-cliff failure and ice-shelf hydrofracture. (iii) We account for changes in the oxygen isotopic composition of the ice sheet by using isotope-enabled climate and ice sheet models. We compare our modeling results with ice-proximal records emerging from a sedimentological drill core from the Ross Sea (Andrill-2A) that is presented in a companion article. The variability in Antarctic ice volume that we simulate is equivalent to a seawater oxygen isotope signal of 0.52-0.66‰, or a sea level equivalent change of 30-36 m, for a range of atmospheric CO2 between 280 and 500 ppm and a changing astronomical configuration. This result represents a substantial advance in resolving the long-standing model data conflict of Miocene Antarctic ice sheet and sea level variability.},

abstract = {Detailed geochemical analyses ($\delta$13Ccarb, $\delta$13Corg, $\delta$34Ssulfide, and abundance of sulfide, carbonate and organic carbon) were performed on samples from the Wangjiawan (Riverside) section, close to the GSSP (Global Strato- type Section and Point) for the Hirnantian stage of the Ordovician. New data show two increases in carbonate content coincident with two glacial pulses that reduced detrital input. The new $\delta$34Ssulfide data show distinct changes in this section, with relatively high values in the Kuanyinchiao Formation, a pattern observed through- out the Yangtze Platform. However, there is no consensus on the cause of these changes. The new $\delta$13Ccarb data show a sharp rise and peak in the extraordinarius zone, below the previously published $\delta$13Corg peak in the persculptus zone. A compilation of the new results with other sections indicates the Hirnantian carbon-isotope excursion starts near the pacificus–extraordinarius boundary and elevated values remain until the end of the excursion in the persculptus zone for both $\delta$13Corg and $\delta$13Ccarb. The controversy over correlating Hirnantian graptolite zones with chitinozoan zones can also be addressed. The new $\delta$13Ccarb data also allow direct compar- ison with Hirnantian $\delta$13Ccarb data from Anticosti Island and the Baltic region, which are zoned by chitinozoan fossils. This comparison favors a correlation of the taugourdeaui and scabra chitinozoan zones with the extraordi- narius graptolite zone.},

abstract = {Abstract The Cretaceous thermal maximum was a major turning point in the history of Earth's climate. This interval of peak warmth in the Turonian has been attributed to very high atmospheric pCO 2 resulting from rapid outgassing rates, although crustal cycling rates peaked in the Aptian–Albian interval. On the basis of coupled ocean-atmosphere model simulations of the middle Cretaceous, we hypothesize that the formation of an Atlantic ...

abstract = {Late Ordovician shales at Kuanyinchiao, southern Sichuan Province, China, contain a muddy micritic limestone Žthe Kuanyinchiao Formation. 0.4 m thick, representing the Hirnantian glaciation, and therefore contain the two extinction events which together comprise the Late Ordovician mass extinction. Wufeng Formation shales underlie, and Lungmachi Formation shales overlie, the limestone, and the Ordovician–Silurian boundary is c. 0.6 m above the base of the Lungmachi Formation. Geochemical analysis of closely spaced samples aids assessment of tectonic and palaeoceanographic change influencing sedimentary facies throughout the interval, but also highlights the value and dangers of geochemical applications in palaeoenvironment study. The immobile elements Hf, Sc, Ta and Th show a consistent asymmetric pattern of abundance; they declined gradually in the upper Wufeng Formation to lower concentrations in calcareous sediments of the Kuanyinchiao Formation because of suppressed erosion and lower sedimentation rate during glaciation. The decline may represent gradual cooling and reduction in erosion rate from source, before preserved sedimentary evidence of the glaciation itself. A sharp return to shale ŽLungmachi Formation., and Hf, Sc, Ta and Th concentrations to pre-glaciation levels, suggest rapid glacial collapse and renewed erosion, probably of the nearby Dianqian Land. These immobile elements co-vary with most REE Žespecially Ce and La., demonstrating that these were also source-controlled, and unaffected by contemporary environmen- tal, or diagenetic, processes. However, partial co-variance of Eu and U with immobiles suggests a combined control of Eu and U by both source variations and redox changes. Anomalies in Ce, Eu and U are often used to identify shifts in oxidation state; at Kuanyinchiao, anomalies which suggest anoxia in the Wufeng Formation are contradicted by benthic faunas which prove the seafloor was oxygenated then, and indicate complex control of those elements.

@article{Armstrong2005a,
abstract = {The upper Ordovician succession of Jordan was located $\sim$608S, less than 100 km from the Hirnantian ice sheet margin. New graptolite dates indicate glaciation ended in Jordan in the late Hirnantian (persculptus Biozone). The succession records two glacial advances within the Ammar Formation and the subsequent deglaciations. Organic-rich black shales (Batra Formation) form part of the final deglacial transgressive succession that in-filled an existing low stand glacial continental shelf topography. The base of the black shale is coincident with the maximum flooding surface. During transgression, interfluves and sub-basin margins were breached and black shale deposition expanded rapidly across the region. The top of the black shales coincides with peak highstand. The bexpanding puddle modelQ (sensu Wignall) for black shale deposition, adapted for the peri-glacial setting, provides the best explanation for this sequence of events.
We propose a hypothesis in which anoxic conditions were initiated beneath the halocline in a salinity stratified water column; a fresher surface layer resulted from ice meltwater generated during early deglaciation. During the initial stages of marine incursion, nutrients in the monimolimnion were isolated from the euphotic zone by the halocline. Increasing total organic carbon (TOC) and d13Corg up section indicates the organic carbon content of the shales was controlled mainly by increasing bioproductivity in the mixolimnion (the Strakhov model). Mixolimnion nutrient levels were sustained by a continual and increasing supply of meltwater-derived nutrients, modulated by obliquity changes in high latitude insolation. Anoxia was sustained over tens to hundreds of thousands of years. The formation of black shales on the north Gondwana shelf was little different to those observed in modern black shale environments, suggesting that it was the nature of the Ordovician seas that pre-disposed them to anoxia.},

@article{Kumpulainen2006,
abstract = {Trace fossils are described here from the Adigrat Sandstone formation of hitherto uncertain Palaeozoic-Mesozoic age in south-central Eritrea. The formation is subdivided into a lower unit, the Adi MaEkheno Member, and an upper informal unit, Member 2. The for- mation was deposited on the locally mudcracked top of the glacigenic Edaga Arbi Beds, suggesting that these two rock units were formed in a very short time interval. The Adi MaEkheno Member and the lower part of Member 2 contain trace fossils Arthrophycus alleghan- iensis (Harlan), Arthrophycus ?brongniartii (Harlan), Didymaulichnus lyelli (Rouault), Palaeophycus tubularis Hall, Taenidium isp., thin winding ridges, winding ridges and furrows, simple cylinders, and ‘stellate' forms. A. alleghaniensis is distinctively of Ordovician–Silurian (?Early Devonian) age. The trace fossil association belongs to the Cruziana ichnofacies that indicates a shallow marine environment between the normal and storm wave bases. The trace fossil data and stratigraphic relationships indicate that the Adigrat Sandstone formation and the Edaga Arbi Beds in Eritrea are Ordovician–Silurian in age. The Edaga Arbi Beds are correlated with other Upper Ordovician (Hirnantian) glacial units in northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, lending these beds the status of a marker unit in the Lower Palaeozoic stratigraphy of the Horn of Africa. The Jurassic ‘‘Adigrat Sandstone'' in central-west and eastern Ethiopia cannot be correlated with the Adigrat Sandstone formation in its type area and in Eritrea.

abstract = {Application of an ice sheet model developed for the Pleistocene to the extensive Carboniferous glaciation on Gondwana yields an ice sheet which has several features consistent with observations. While complete deglaciation is not achieved without CO changes, the Milankovich-induced #uctuations in ice sheet volume are comparable to Pleistocene glacial/ interglacial signals. This result is shown to hold for a large fraction of physically reasonable parameter space. The model also exhibits multiple equilibria and sharp bifurcations, as in"nitesimal changes in the solar constant or precipitation can lead to a qualitatively di!erent climate. The success of the model in predicting ice location in an environment quite di!erent from the Pleistocene provides additional support for the robust- ness of the basic model physics and suggests that the model can be applied with some con"dence to other pre-Pleistocene glaciations.},

@article{Brayard2017,
abstract = {In the wake of the end-Permian mass extinction, the Early Triassic ($\sim$251.9 to 247 million years ago) is portrayed as an environmentally unstable interval characterized by several biotic crises and heavily depauperate marine benthic ecosystems. We describe a new fossil assemblage-the Paris Biota-from the earliest Spathian (middle Olenekian, $\sim$250.6 million years ago) of the Bear Lake area, southeastern Idaho, USA. This highly diversified assemblage documents a remarkably complex marine ecosystem including at least seven phyla and 20 distinct metazoan orders, along with algae. Most unexpectedly, it combines early Paleozoic and middle Mesozoic taxa previously unknown from the Triassic strata, among which are primitive Cambrian-Ordovician leptomitid sponges (a 200-million year Lazarus taxon) and gladius-bearing coleoid cephalopods, a poorly documented group before the Jurassic ($\sim$50 million years after the Early Triassic). Additionally, the crinoid and ophiuroid specimens show derived anatomical characters that were thought to have evolved much later. Unlike previous works that suggested a sluggish postcrisis recovery and a low diversity for the Early Triassic benthic organisms, the unexpected composition of this exceptional assemblage points toward an early and rapid post-Permian diversification for these clades. Overall, it illustrates a phylogenetically diverse, functionally complex, and trophically multileveled marine ecosystem, from primary producers up to top predators and potential scavengers. Hence, the Paris Biota highlights the key evolutionary position of Early Triassic fossil ecosystems in the transition from the Paleozoic to the Modern marine evolutionary fauna at the dawn of the Mesozoic era.},

abstract = {Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is a relatively new paleotemperature proxy based on measure- ments of the degree of ordering of 13C and 18O into bonds with each other (making the 13C18O16O␣2 2 ion group) in lattices of carbonate minerals. This technique has several unusual properties that complement existing methods of paleoclimate reconstruction. Most importantly, it is based on a homogeneous isotope exchange equilibrium and thus constrains temperature independent of the isotopic composition of waters from which carbonates grew. This method also appears to be generally insensitive to ‘vital effects' that compromise many other paleothermometers based on the chemical properties of biominerals or organic matter, at least for those organisms that have been subjected to systematic study to-date (corals and foraminifera); however, discrepancies among some calibrations, particularly at low temperatures, may point toward the existence of vital effects in mollusks and other organisms. This review discusses the principles and calibrations of the technique, its uses in combination with conventional stable isotope measurements to constrain the d18O of past waters, preservation of paleotemperatures in ancient materials, as well as current problems in our understanding of calibrations and interlaboratory data comparisons.},

abstract = {The Campo section is a parastratotype section for the shallow-water Ilerdian and Cuisian stages. Although a lot of work has been concentrated during the last years on biostratigraphy, sequence stratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and geochemistry, surprisingly little work has been published on the facies development. Here we evaluate the facies evolution with particular emphasis on the biogenic assemblages of the latest Paleocene (shallow benthic zonation 4) to the earliest Eocene (shallow benthic zonations 5 and 6) of the Campo and the nearby Serraduy section. Overall, the facies show a deepening in the Paleocene and the Eocene, interrupted by a terrestrial interval across the newly defined Paleocene/Eocene boundary. In the late Paleocene altogether seven microfacies types were distinguished. These are dominated by various algal taxa and subordinate corals and larger foraminifera. The lower Eocene carbonate platform is characterised by twelve microfacies types, which are dominated by larger foraminifera such as alveolinids, orbitolitids and nummulitids and subordinate corals. This facies dichotomy recognized in the Campo and Serraduy sections can be extrapolated to the whole Pyrenean region in the early Paleogene and is even found in Egypt. The comparison of the two regions shows that the facies dichotomy is less pronounced in the Pyrenean region. This is interpreted to reflect a latitudinal trend, where corals are absent in the low latitudes, while in the middle latitudes they occur subordinately. This gradient within the facies distribution can be explained by latitudinal temperature changes and by the long-time warming in the early Paleogene and the short-time warming of the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum. Hot temperatures in the low latitudes hamper the growth of temperature sensitive corals, while in the middle latitudes the temperatures were still in a favourable temperature range.},

abstract = {Hypoxia is a mounting problem affecting the world's coastal waters, with severe consequences for marine life, including death and catastrophic changes. Hypoxia is forecast to increase owing to the combined effects of the continued spread of coastal eutrophication and global warming. A broad comparative analysis across a range of contrasting marine benthic organisms showed that hypoxia thresholds vary greatly across marine benthic organisms and that the conventional definition of 2 mg O(2)/liter to designate waters as hypoxic is below the empirical sublethal and lethal O(2) thresholds for half of the species tested. These results imply that the number and area of coastal ecosystems affected by hypoxia and the future extent of hypoxia impacts on marine life have been generally underestimated.},

The upper palaeovalley-fill comprises glaciofluvial and marine sandstones, incised into the lower palaeovalley or, where this is absent, into the Tubeiliyat Formation. Southern Jordan lay close to the margin of a Late Ordovician terrestrial ice sheet in Northwest Saudi Arabia, characterised by two major ice advances. These are correlated with the lower and upper palaeovalleys in southern Jordan, interrupted by two subsidiary glacial advances during late stage filling of the lower palaeovalley when ice advanced from the west and northwest. Thus, four ice advances are now recorded from the Late Ordovician glacial record of southern Jordan.
Disturbed and deformed green sandstones beneath the upper palaeovalley-fill in the Jebel Ammar area, are confined to the margins of the Hutayya graben, and have been interpreted as structureless glacial loessite or glacial rock flour. Petrographic and textural analyses of the deformed sandstones, their mapped lateral transition into undeformed Tubeiliyat marine sandstones away from the fault zone, and the presence of similar sedimentary structures to those in the pre-glacial marine Tubeiliyat Formation suggest that they are a locally deformed facies equivalent of the Tubeiliyat, not part of the younger glacial deposits. Deformation is attributed to glacially induced crustal stresses and seismic reactivation of pre-existing faults, previously weakened by epeirogenesis, triggering sediment liquefaction and deformation typical of earthquake generated seismites. Deformation, confined to an area of not more than 4 km wide adjacent to the major fault zone, implies earthquake magnitudes of at least 6 (Mo). The high authigenic chlorite content of deformed Tubeiliyat sandstones compared to undeformed ones is attributed to a post-seismic hydrothermal system driven by compactional dewatering and hydrofracturing of the bedrock which acted as a groundwater recharge area, supplied by subglacial meltwater from beneath the ice sheet. Fluid movement along glacial seismotectonically reactivated faults infiltrated the adjacent Tubeiliyat sandstones under pressure and elevated geothermal gradient, where chlorite was precipitated from solution.},

abstract = {Through its ability to transport large amounts of heat, fresh water and nutrients, the ocean is an essential regulator of climate. The pathways and mechanisms of this transport and its stability are critical issues in understanding the present state of climate and the possibilities of future changes. Recently, global high-quality hydrographic data have been gathered in the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), to obtain an accurate picture of the present circulation. Here we combine the new data from high-resolution trans-oceanic sections and current meters with climatological wind fields, biogeochemical balances and improved a priori error estimates in an inverse model, to improve estimates of the global circulation and heat fluxes. Our solution resolves globally vertical mixing across surfaces of equal density, with coefficients in the range (3-12) x 10(-4) m2 s(-1). Net deep-water production rates amount to (15 +/- 12) x 10(6) m3 s(-1) in the North Atlantic Ocean and (21 +/- 6) x 10(6) m3 s(-1) in the Southern Ocean. Our estimates provide a new reference state for future climate studies with rigorous estimates of the uncertainties.},

@article{Finnegan2012,
abstract = {Selectivity patterns provide insights into the causes of ancient ex- tinction events. The Late Ordovician mass extinction was related to Gondwanan glaciation; however, it is still unclear whether ele- vated extinction rates were attributable to record failure, habitat loss, or climatic cooling. We examined Middle Ordovician-Early Silurian North American fossil occurrences within a spatiotempo- rally explicit stratigraphic framework that allowed us to quantify rock record effects on a per-taxon basis and assay the interplay of macrostratigraphic and macroecological variables in determining extinction risk. Genera that had large proportions of their observed geographic ranges affected by stratigraphic truncation or environ- mental shifts at the end of the Katian stage were particularly hard hit. The duration of the subsequent sampling gaps had little effect on extinction risk, suggesting that this extinction pulse cannot be entirely attributed to rock record failure; rather, it was caused, in part, by habitat loss. Extinction risk at this time was also strongly influenced by the maximum paleolatitude at which a genus had previously been sampled, a macroecological trait linked to thermal tolerance. A model trained on the relationship between 16 expla- natory variables and extinction patterns during the early Katian interval substantially underestimates the extinction of exclusively tropical taxa during the late Katian interval. These results indicate that glacioeustatic sea-level fall and tropical ocean cooling played important roles in the first pulse of the Late Ordovician mass ex- tinction in Laurentia.},

abstract = {Landsat images, ASTER digital elevation models, aerial photographs, and field investigations in the western Murzuq Basin (Libya) and the adjacent Tassili N'Ajjers (Algeria) provide paleo- geomorphological evidence for the existence of a Late Ordovician ice stream at least 200 km long and 80 km wide. This includes mega-scale glacial lineations, an associated subglacial meltwater drainage system, and ice-front features. This first comprehensive description of a pre-Cenozoic ice stream may help to identify other examples in the Proterozoic to Paleozoic glacial record. Recon- struction of the extent and behavior of former ice sheets, and res- ervoir prospect analysis in glacially related successions, have to take into account the potential occurrence of ice streams.},

@article{Ghienne2014,
abstract = {The end-Ordovician was an enigmatic interval in the Phanerozoic, known for massive glaciation potentially at elevated CO2 levels, biogeochemical cycle disruptions recorded as large isotope anomalies and a devastating extinction event. Ice-sheet volumes claimed to be twice those of the Last Glacial Maximum paradoxically coincided with oceans as warm as today. Here we argue that some of these remarkable claims arise from undersampling of incomplete geological sections that led to apparent temporal correlations within the relatively coarse resolution capability of Palaeozoic biochronostratigraphy. We examine exceptionally complete sedimentary records from two, low and high, palaeolatitude settings. Their correlation framework reveals a Cenozoic-style scenario including three main glacial cycles and higher-order phenomena. This necessitates revision of mechanisms for the end-Ordovician events, as the first extinction is tied to an early phase of melting, not to initial cooling, and the largest $\delta$(13)C excursion occurs during final deglaciation, not at the glacial apex.},
